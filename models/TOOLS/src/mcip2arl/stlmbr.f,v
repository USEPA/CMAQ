!*  GENERAL CONFORMAL MAP ROUTINES FOR METEOROLOGICAL MODELERS
!*  WRITTEN ON 3/31/94 BY

!* Dr. Albion Taylor
!* NOAA / OAR / ARL                  Phone: (301) 713-0295 x 132
!* Rm. 3151, 1315 East-West Highway  Fax:   (301) 713-0119

!*  SUBROUTINE STLMBR (STRCMP, TNGLAT, CLONG)
!*    THIS ROUTINE INITIALIZES THE MAP STRUCTURE ARRAY STRCMP TO
!*    THE FORM OF A SPECIFIC MAP PROJECTION
!*  INPUTS:
!*    TNGLAT - THE LATITUDE AT WHICH THE PROJECTION WILL BE TANGENT
!*             TO THE EARTH.  +90. FOR NORTH POLAR STEREOGRAPHIC,
!*             -90. FOR SOUTH POLAR STEREOGRAPHIC, 0. FOR MERCATOR,
!*             AND OTHER VALUES FOR LAMBERT CONFORMAL.
!*             -90 <= TNGLAT <= 90.
!*    CLONG -  A LONGITUDE IN THE REGION UNDER CONSIDERATION.  LONGITUDES
!*             BETWEEN CLONG-180. AND CLONG+180.  WILL BE MAPPED IN ONE
!*             CONNECTED REGION
!*  OUTPUTS:
!*    STRCMP - A 9-VALUE MAP STRUCTURE ARRAY FOR USE WITH SUBSEQUENT
!*             CALLS TO THE COORDINATE TRANSFORM ROUTINES.
!*
!*  REAL FUNCTION EQVLAT (XLAT1,XLAT2)
!*    THIS FUNCTION IS PROVIDED TO ASSIST IN FINDING THE TANGENT LATITUDE
!*    EQUIVALENT TO THE 2-REFERENCE LATITUDE SPECIFICATION IN THE LEGEND
!*    OF MOST LAMBERT CONFORMAL MAPS.  IF THE MAP SPECIFIES "SCALE
!*    1:XXXXX TRUE AT 40N AND 60N", THEN EQVLAT(40.,60.) WILL RETURN THE
!*    EQUIVALENT TANGENT LATITUDE.
!*  INPUTS:
!*    XLAT1,XLAT2:  THE TWO LATITUDES SPECIFIED IN THE MAP LEGEND
!*  RETURNS:
!*    THE EQUIVALENT TANGENT LATITUDE
!*  EXAMPLE:  CALL STLMBR(STRCMP, EQVLAT(40.,60.), 90.)

!*    ARRAY BY CONFORMING THE MAP COORDINATES TO THE SPECIFICATIONS
!*    OF A PARTICULAR GRID.  EITHER STCM1P OR STCM2P MUST BE CALLED,
!*    BUT NOT BOTH
!*  INPUTS:
!*    STRCMP - A 9-VALUE MAP STRUCTURE ARRAY, SET TO A PARTICULAR MAP
!*             FORM BY A PREVIOUS CALL TO STLMBR
!*    FOR STCM2P:

!*             SAME TWO POINTS

!*      X1,Y1 - THE MAP COORDINATES OF ONE POINT ON THE GRID
!*      XLAT1,XLONG1 - THE GEOGRAPHIC COORDINATES OF THE SAME POINT
!*      XLATG,XLONGG - LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE OF REFERENCE POINT FOR
!*             GRIDSZ AND ORIENTATION SPECIFICATION.

!*    IN THE DIRECTION OF THE NORTH POLAR AXIS.  WHEN MULTIPLIED
!*    BY TWICE THE ROTATION RATE OF THE EARTH (2 * PI/24 HR), THE
!*    VERTICAL COMPONENT YIELDS THE CORIOLIS FACTOR.

!*    INTENDED TO BE CALLED DIRECTLY

!*  REAL FUNCTION CSPANF (VALUE, BEGIN, END)
!*    THIS FUNCTION ASSISTS OTHER ROUTINES IN PROVIDING A LONGITUDE IN
!*    THE PROPER RANGE.  IT ADDS TO VALUE WHATEVER MULTIPLE OF
