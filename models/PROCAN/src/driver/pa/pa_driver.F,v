!  The Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) system software is in     !
!  continuous development by various groups and is based on information  !
!  from these groups: Federal Government employees, contractors working  !
!  within a United States Government contract, and non-Federal sources   !
!  including research institutions.  These groups give the Government    !
!  permission to use, prepare derivative works of, and distribute copies !
!  of their work in the CMAQ system to the public and to permit others   !
!  to do so.  The United States Environmental Protection Agency          !
!  therefore grants similar permission to use the CMAQ system software,  !
!  but users are requested to provide copies of derivative works or      !
!  products designed to operate in the CMAQ system to the United States  !
!  Government without restrictions as to use by others.  Software        !
!  that is used with the CMAQ system but distributed under the GNU       !
!  General Public License or the GNU Lesser General Public License is    !
!  subject to their copyright restrictions.                              !

      PROGRAM PA_MAIN

C***********************************************************************
C Function: Read the process analysis input commands and generate
C           include files, listings, etc. for use in Models3
C           process analysis  
 
C Preconditions: The program requires include files generated by
C                the Models3 Program Control Processor that 
C                contain information about the chemical mechanism,
C                its species, aerosols, non-reactives, and tracers

C  Revision History:
C  Prototype created by Jerry Gipson, August, 1996
C  Modified May, 1997 by Jerry Gipson to be consistent with beta CTM
C  Modified Sept, 1997 by Jerry Gipson to be consistent with targeted CTM
C  Updated May 2002 by Jerry Gipson for dynamic allocation version of CCTM
C  Aug 2011 Jeff Young: Replaced I/O API include files with IOAPI's M3UTILIO
