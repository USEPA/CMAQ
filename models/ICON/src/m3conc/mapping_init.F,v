!  The Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) system software is in     !
!  continuous development by various groups and is based on information  !
!  from these groups: Federal Government employees, contractors working  !
!  within a United States Government contract, and non-Federal sources   !
!  including research institutions.  These groups give the Government    !
!  permission to use, prepare derivative works of, and distribute copies !
!  of their work in the CMAQ system to the public and to permit others   !
!  to do so.  The United States Environmental Protection Agency          !
!  therefore grants similar permission to use the CMAQ system software,  !
!  but users are requested to provide copies of derivative works or      !
!  products designed to operate in the CMAQ system to the United States  !
!  Government without restrictions as to use by others.  Software        !
!  that is used with the CMAQ system but distributed under the GNU       !

C Purpose:
 
C Initialize the starting column and row location of the new shifted 
C decomposition
 
C Revision history:
 
C   Orginal version: 02/15/00 by David Wong, LM
 
C   7/20/00 David Wong, LM
C           -- convert XCELL_C, YCELL_C, XCELL_F, and YCELL_F into integer
C              before computing the ratio. This will avoid machine precision
C              problem to compute the ratio first and let the machine to
C              convert the answer into integer.
C   2/20/02 David Wong, LM
C           -- modified the ROW_DISP and COL_DISP calculations for the cases 
C              when the corresponding *_RATIO is 1 which means resolutions are 
C              the same in the fine and coarse grid.
C           -- modified the arithmetic when accessing the 2nd index of COLSX_PE 
C              and ROWSX_PE since they are starting from 1 rather than from 0.
C   27 May 06 J.Young: ck appropriate grid resolutions; changed row/col to
C                      col/row
                          
C Argument list:
 
C In:
C        XCELL_C -- resolution of the x-direction in the coarse domain
C        YCELL_C -- resolution of the y-direction in the coarse domain
C        XCELL_F -- resolution of the x-direction in the fine domain
C        YCELL_F -- resolution of the y-direction in the fine domain
C        COL     -- number of steps that the fine domain (1,1) cell needs to 
C                   leave the current coarse domain grid cell in the column
C                   direction
C        ROW     -- number of steps that the fine domain (1,1) cell needs to 
C                   leave the current coarse domain grid cell in the row 
C                   direction
 
C Out:
C        COL_RATIO -- the ratio between number of columns of the fine domain to
C                     the coarse domain
C        ROW_RATIO -- the ratio between number of rows of the fine domain to
C                     the coarse domain
C        COL_DISP  -- the column-wise distance between the starting point of 
C                     the fine domain and the coarse grid boundary;
C                     with a parallel decomposition, between the starting point of
C                     the fine domain in a processor and the coarse grid boundary
C                     (not nec. the physical application boundary)
C        ROW_DISP  -- the row-wise distance between the starting point of
C                     the fine domain and the coarse grid boundary;
C                     with a parallel decomposition, between the starting point of
C                     the fine domain in a processor and the coarse grid boundary
C                     (not nec. the physical application boundary)
 
C InOut:
C        COL_LOC   -- In:  the column location of the (1,1) cell of the fine
C                          domain in the coarse domain
C                     Out: the column location of the starting cell of the fine
C                          domain in the coarse domain
C        ROW_LOC   -- In:  the row location of the (1,1) cell of the fine 
C                          domain in the coarse domain
C                     Out: the row location of the starting cell of the fine 
C                          domain in the coarse domain
