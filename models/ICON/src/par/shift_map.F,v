!  The Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) system software is in     !
!  continuous development by various groups and is based on information  !
!  from these groups: Federal Government employees, contractors working  !
!  within a United States Government contract, and non-Federal sources   !
!  including research institutions.  These groups give the Government    !
!  permission to use, prepare derivative works of, and distribute copies !
!  of their work in the CMAQ system to the public and to permit others   !
!  to do so.  The United States Environmental Protection Agency          !
!  therefore grants similar permission to use the CMAQ system software,  !
!  but users are requested to provide copies of derivative works or      !
!  products designed to operate in the CMAQ system to the United States  !
!  Government without restrictions as to use by others.  Software        !

      SUBROUTINE SHIFT_MAP ( NCOLS, NROWS, MY_NCOLS, MY_NROWS,
     &                       GL_NCOLS_IN, GL_NROWS_IN, NCOLS_IN, NROWS_IN,

C ----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Purpose:
 
C To re-decompose the coarse grid domain with respect to the position of the
C fine grid domain by shifting CONC and re-calculating COL_LOC and ROW_LOC 
C accordingly.
 
C Revision history:
 
C   02/15/00 by David Wong, LM
C   -- Orginal version
 
C   10/10/00 by David Wong, LM
C   -- replaced SUBST_CSG_INDEX with SUBST_SUBGRID_INDEX 
C      after unification of subroutines SUBST_CSF_INDEX and 
C      SUBST_FSG_INDX in the STENEX library and removed one
C      argument in the SUBST_DATA_COPY routine with respect
C      to the unification.
 
C   04/10/02 by David Wong, LM
C   -- Fixed the incorrect arguments order in the 
C      SUBST_SUBGRID_INDEX call statement.
 
C   12/21/04 J.Young
C   -- Changed the argument list
 
C Argument list:
 
C In:
C        NCOLS       -- number of fine domain columns in this processor
C        NROWS       -- number of fine domain rows    in this processor
C        MY_NCOLS    -- number of fine domain data columns in this processor
C        MY_NROWS    -- number of fine domain data    rows in this processor
C        GL_NCOLS_IN -- number of coarse domain columns
C        GL_NROWS_IN -- number of coarse domain rows
C        NCOLS_IN    -- number of coarse domain columns in this processor
C        NROWS_IN    -- number of coarse domain rows    in this processor
C        NLAYS_IN    -- number of coarse domain layers
C        NSPCS_IN    -- number of coarse domain species
 
C InOut:
C        COL_LOC     -- column position of a grid point of the fine domain 
C                       relative to the coarse domain in a processor 
C        ROW_LOC     -- row position of a grid point of the fine domain 
C                       relative to the coarse domain in a processor 
C        CONC        -- concentration field
