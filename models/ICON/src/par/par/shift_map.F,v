        SUBROUTINE SHIFT_MAP ( NCOLS, NROWS, COL_LOC, ROW_LOC, 
     &                         MY_NCOLS, MY_NROWS, GL_NCOLS_IN, GL_NROWS_IN,
     &                         NCOLS_IN, NROWS_IN, NLAYS_IN, NSPCS_IN, CONC )

C ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
C Purpose:
 
C To re-decompose the coarse grid domain with respect to the position of the
C fine grid domain by shifting CONC and re-calculating COL_LOC and ROW_LOC 
C accordingly.
 
C Revision history:
 
C   02/15/00 by David Wong, LM
C   -- Orginal version
 
C   10/10/00 by David Wong, LM
C   -- replaced SUBST_CSG_INDEX with SUBST_SUBGRID_INDEX 
C      after unification of subroutines SUBST_CSF_INDEX and 
C      SUBST_FSG_INDX in the STENEX library and removed one
C      argument in the SUBST_DATA_COPY routine with respect
C      to the unification.
 
C   04/10/02 by David Wong, LM
C   -- Fixed the incorrect arguments order in the 
C      SUBST_SUBGRID_INDEX call statement.
 
C   12/21/04 J.Young
C   -- Changed the argument list
 
C Argument list:
 
C In:
C        NCOLS       -- number of columns of the fine domain in a processor
C        NROWS       -- number of rows of the fine domain in a processor
C        MY_NCOLS    -- number of data columns of the fine domain a a processor
C        MY_NROWS    -- number of data rows of the fine domain a a processor
C        GL_NCOLS_IN -- number of columns of the coarse domain
C        GL_NROWS_IN -- number of rows of the coarse domain
C        NCOLS_IN    -- number of columns of the coarse domain in a processor
C        NROWS_IN    -- number of rows of the coarse domain in a processor
C        NLAYS_IN    -- number of layers of the coarse domain in a processor
C        NSPCS_IN    -- number of species of the coarse domain in a processor
 
C InOut:
C        CONC        -- concentration field
C        COL_LOC     -- column position of a grid point of the fine domain 
C                       relative to the coarse domain in a processor 
C        ROW_LOC     -- row position of a grid point of the fine domain 
C                       relative to the coarse domain in a processor
