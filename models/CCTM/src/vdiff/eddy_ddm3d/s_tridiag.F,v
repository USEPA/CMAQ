C  Significant portions of Models-3/CMAQ software were developed by        *
C  Government employees and under a United States Government contract.     *
C  Portions of the software were also based on information from non-       *
C  Federal sources, including software developed by research institutions  *
C  through jointly funded cooperative agreements. These research institu-  *
C  tions have given the Government permission to use, prepare derivative   *
C  works, and distribute copies of their work to the public within the     *
C  Models-3/CMAQ software release and to permit others to do so. EPA       *
C  therefore grants similar permissions for use of Models-3/CMAQ software, *
C  but users are requested to provide copies of derivative works to the    *
C  Government without re-strictions as to use by others.  Users are        *
C  responsible for acquiring their own copies of commercial software       *
C  associated with the Models-3/CMAQ release and are also responsible      *

      SUBROUTINE STRIDIAG SUBST_GRID_ID ( L, D, U, B, X, NPMAX )
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

C  FUNCTION:
C    Modified from TRIDIAG, to handle sensitivities. Main difference
C    is that it loops over the sens parameters.
C    Solves tridiagonal system by Thomas algorithm.  Algorithm fails
C    ( M3ERR ) if first pivot is zero.  In that case, rewrite the
C    equation as a set of order KMAX-1, with X(2) trivially eliminated.
C The associated tri-diagonal system is stored in 3 arrays
C   D : diagonal
C   L : sub-diagonal
C   U : super-diagonal
C   B : right hand side function
C   X : return solution from tridiagonal solver

C     [ D(1) U(1) 0    0    0 ...       0     ]
C     [ L(2) D(2) U(2) 0    0 ...       .     ]
C     [ 0    L(3) D(3) U(3) 0 ...       .     ]
C     [ .       .     .     .           .     ] X(i) = B(i)
C     [ .             .     .     .     0     ]
C     [ .                   .     .     .     ]
C     [ 0                           L(n) D(n) ]

C   where n = NLAYS

C  PRECONDITIONS REQUIRED:
