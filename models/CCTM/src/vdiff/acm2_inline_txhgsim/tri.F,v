      SUBROUTINE TRI ( L, D, U, B, X )
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

C  FUNCTION:
C    Solves tridiagonal system by Thomas algorithm.  Algorithm fails
C    ( M3ERR ) if first pivot is zero.  In that case, rewrite the
C    equation as a set of order KMAX-1, with X(2) trivially eliminated.
C The associated tri-diagonal system is stored in 3 arrays
C   D : diagonal
C   L : sub-diagonal
C   U : super-diagonal
C   B : right hand side function
C   X : return solution from tridiagonal solver

C     [ D(1) U(1) 0    0    0 ...       0     ]
C     [ L(2) D(2) U(2) 0    0 ...       .     ]
C     [ 0    L(3) D(3) U(3) 0 ...       .     ]
C     [ .       .     .     .           .     ] X(i) = B(i)
C     [ .             .     .     .     0     ]
C     [ .                   .     .     .     ]
C     [ 0                           L(n) D(n) ]

C   where n = NLAYS

C  PRECONDITIONS REQUIRED:
C    Dimensionality set up in terms of NLAYS from SUBST_VGRD_ID

      USE VGRD_DEFN           ! vertical layer specifications

      IMPLICIT NONE

C Includes:

!     INCLUDE SUBST_VGRD_ID   ! vertical dimensioning parameters
      INCLUDE SUBST_GC_DIFF   ! gas chem diffusion species and map table
      INCLUDE SUBST_AE_DIFF   ! aerosol diffusion species and map table
      INCLUDE SUBST_NR_DIFF   ! non-react diffusion species and map table
      INCLUDE SUBST_TR_DIFF   ! tracer diffusion species and map table

C Arguments:

      REAL        L( NLAYS )               ! subdiagonal
      REAL        D( NLAYS )               ! diagonal

C Local Variables:

      REAL        GAM( NLAYS )
      REAL        BET
      INTEGER     V, K

C Decomposition and forward substitution:
      BET = 1.0 / D( 1 )
      DO V = 1, N_SPC_DIFF
         X( V,1 ) = BET * B(V,1 )
      END DO

      DO K = 2, NLAYS
         GAM( K ) = BET * U( K-1 )
         BET = 1.0 / ( D( K ) - L( K ) * GAM( K ) )
	 DO V = 1, N_SPC_DIFF
            X( V, K ) = BET * ( B( V,K ) - L( K ) * X( V,K-1 ) )
	 END DO
      END DO

C Back-substitution:

      DO K = NLAYS - 1, 1, -1
         DO V = 1, N_SPC_DIFF
            X( V,K ) = X( V,K ) - GAM( K+1 ) * X( V,K+1 )
