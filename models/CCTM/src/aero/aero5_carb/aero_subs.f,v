c  This collection of subroutines is version 5 of the CMAQ aerosol 
c  component (AERO5).  It is based upon the version described by 
c  Binkowski & Roselle (2003), with updated treatment of the sea-salt
c  and SOA species.
c
c //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
c  SUBROUTINE AEROPROC advances the number, second moment, and mass
c   concentrations for each mode over the time interval DT.  Other 
c   than CBLK and ORGPROD, all arguments are scalar.
c 
c  KEY SUBROUTINES CALLED:
c     GETPAR, ORGAER5, HETCHEM, HCOND3, NEWPART3, GETCOAGS,
c     INTERCOAG_GH, INTRACOAG_GH, VOLINORG
c 
c  KEY FUNCTIONS CALLED:  ERF, ERFC, GETAF
c 
c  REVISION HISTORY:
c     Coded in December 1999 by Dr. Francis S. Binkowski
c      Modified from older versions used in CMAQ, eliminated separate
c      routines for coagulation and growth by including these processes
c      in line.  This code is now a scalar code and has no internal
c      spatial arrays.
c 
c FSB 05/17/00  new version of RPMARES included
c 
c FSB 05/30/00  Fixed minor bug in awater.f
c 
c FSB Correction to extinction coefficient in getbext.
c 
c FSB 07/21/00 corrected units on ORGRATES and ORGBRATE_IN from 
c      ppm/min to ppm/sec in AEROPROC and AEROSTEP.
c 
c FSB 11/30/00 following changes from 07/28/00
c     Fixed problem for new emissions file version
c     Combined emissions for M3
c     Used a fixed value of Dpmin for plotting
c     Added variables OMEGA_AT & OMEGA_AC for partitioning
c     Eliminated the restriction on relative humidity for nucleation.
c     Added a branch in EQL for very low relative humidity (<1%).
c 
c FSB Following changes to RPMARES:
c     Number of iterations reduced from 150 to 50.
c     Iterations are used only if 0.5 < = RATIO.
c     In calculating the molality of the bisulfate ion, a
c     MAX(1.0e-10, MSO4 ) is used.
c 
c FSB 08/08/01 Changes to NEWPART to correct mass rate and to AEROSTEP
c     to correct sulfate, include emissions, and trap problem in
c     accumulation mode number calculation.
c 
c FSB 09/19/01 Version AE3, major changes
c     Organics are done with Dr. Benedikt Schell's approach. (ORGAER3)
c     Particle production uses Kulmala approach (NEWPART3)
c     Condensational factors for sulfate and organics are calculated
c      separately.
c     Emissions are assumed to be input in vertical diffusion.
c     Include files replaced by Fortran 90 Modules.
c     The modules also contain subroutines.
c 
c FSB 10/24/01 Added the treatment of gaseous N2O5 -> aerosol HNO3
c 
c FSB 10/25/01 Changed the mass transfer calculation for Aitken to 
c     accumulation mode by coagulation as recommended by Dr. Benedikt
c     Schell.
c 
c SJR 04/24/02 Replaced thermodynamic code RPMARES with ISORROPIA
c     --Shawn J. Roselle
c 
c GLG 04/04/03 Modifications to allow for evaporation of semi-volatile
c     organics from aerosol phase.  --Gerald L. Gipson
c 
c FSB 11/18/03 Corrections to sulfate condensation.  Previously, 
c     SCONDRATE was undefined when SO4RATE=0 and SCONDRATE was 
c     negative when SO4RATE < DMDT_so4.
c 
c PVB 01/08/04 Several changes in preparation for simulation of 2001
c      calendar year --Dr. Prakash V. Bhave
c    -Added interface to new subroutine, GETCOAGS, for calculating 
c      coagulation rates.  GETCOAGS is used instead of Gauss-Hermite
c      quadrature for computational efficiency, by setting
c      FASTCOAG_FLAG = .TRUE.  --PVB
c    -Removed SOA from the definition of "DRY" aerosol.  Aerosol surface
c      area is now transported without SOA.  See notes in GETPAR, AERO,
c      and AERO_DEPV subroutines.  --SJR
c    -Moved EQL3 call from AEROPROC to AEROSTEP, immediately following
c      the ORGAER3 call.  This is a side effect of transporting aerosol 
c      surface area without SOA.  --SJR
c    -New subroutine, HCOND3, to calculate condensation rates for
c      2nd and 3rd moments.  Results are unchanged.  --FSB
c    -Revised method of calculating SOA.  Partition SOA to the modes 
c      in proportion to the amounts of total organic mass (SOA plus 
c      primary) in each mode.  Modal geometric standard deviations are
c      now preserved during SOA condensation and evaporation. --FSB
c    -Combined the former subroutines AEROPROC and AEROSTEP into this
c      subroutine; retained the name AEROPROC.  --PVB
c 
c PVB 09/21/04 added in-line documentation with input from FSB.
c     Changed MWH2SO4 from 98.07354 to 98.0 g/mol for consistency with
c     the mechanism files.
c 
c PVB 09/27/04 removed the IF(XM3.GT.0.0) mode-merging precondition 
c     because it caused significant erroneous mode crossover.  Fix
c     suggested by Dr. Chris Nolte.
c 
c PVB 01/19/05 Added SO4RATE to the EQL3 call vector.  This is necessary
c     to ensure that the gas and inorganic fine PM (i+j) concentrations
c     are in thermodynamic equilibrium at the end of each time step.
c 
c PVB 05/02/05 Modified ERF statement function for negative arguments such 
c     that erf(-x) = -erf(x).  Previous version had erf(-x) = erf(x).
c 
c PVB 04/06/06 Added GAMMA_N2O5 to the AEROPROC and EQL3 call vectors, 
c     so it can be written to the aerosol diagnostic file.
c 
c SLN 09/07/07 Several changes in preparation for new SOA module
c    -Removed Aitken-mode SOA species (CBLK(VORGAI),CBLK(VORGBI)) and 
c     all of the related variables (OMASS_I, OMASS_J, FRACI, FRACJ,
c     OLD_M2_I, OLD_M3_I, NEW_M2_I, NEW_M3_I)
c    -Replaced the other SOA species (CBLK(VORGAJ),CBLK(VORGBJ)) with
c     precursor-specific SOA species (e.g., CBLK(VTOL1J)).
c    -Replaced SOA_A and SOA_B with an array, SOA_ALL.  Replaced 
c     OLDSOA_A and OLDSOA_B with an array, OLDSOA.  Updated ORGAER3
c     call vector accordingly.
c    -Removed dependence of mode-merging criteria on SOA condensation
c     because that logic was flawed.  Deleted all variables needed
c     for that calculation (CHEMRATE_ORG, ORGRATE, ORGBRATE).
c 
c PVB 11/02/07 Moved heterogenous N2O5 chemistry from EQL3 to a new
c     subroutine, HETCHEM.
c 
c PVB 11/29/07 Implementation of new SOA formation mechanisms
c    -Replaced call to ORGAER3 with a call to ORGAER5
c    -Moved CBLK updates of SV species, SOA species, M2, and M3 into
c     ORGAER5 instead of updating those values in AEROPROC
c
c JOY 04/08/08 White space, alignment, readability
c
c JTK 04/17/08 Implemented coarse chemistry updates
c     -replaced condensation calculations with call to VOLINORG
c     -added code for coarse surface area and variable crse std. dev.
c     -modified modal dynamics equations because new particle formation
c      and growth are now calculated in VOLINORG
c  
c JOY 12/07/08 Removed unused EQL3 code, add column and row arguments to
c     VOLINORG for diagnostic logging
c
c SLN 10/05/09 Added species for apportionment of primary OC & EC

c     This code implements Section 1.4 of Binkowski and Roselle (2003)
c     with two notable exceptions.  1) emissions are treated in
c     CMAQ's vertical diffusion routine, so they do not appear in the
c     following equations. 2) new particle formation and condensational
c     growth are now treated in the VOLINORG subroutine, so they do not
c     appear in the following equations.
c
c     M2 is updated before M0 because the intermodal transfer rate of
c     M2 is a function of the number concentrations.  In contrast,
c     production and loss rates of M0 are independent of M2.  Advancing
c     M2 before M0 avoids operator splitting within the modal-dynamic-
c     equation solution.  A similar rearrangement would be necessary
c     for the M3 update, but the dependence of M3 on number
c     concentrations already is accounted for in the C30ATAC term.

C *** UPDATE SECOND MOMENT

c     Aitken mode mass concentration rates of change are of the form:
c       dc/dt = P - L*c    ! Equation 9a of Binkowski & Roselle (2003)
c     with solution
c       c(t0 + dt) = P/L + ( c(t0) - P/L ) * exp(-L*dt)

c     For all species, loss of Aitken mode mass is due to intermodal
c     coagulation.
c       LOSSn = PI/6 * RHOn * C30ATAC / MASSn
c       RHOn  = MASSn / (M3 * PI/6)
c     When above equations are combined, the PI/6 terms cancel yielding
c       LOSSn = C30ATAC / M3
c     where LOSSn is the loss rate of species n, RHOn is the mass of
c     species n per unit of particle volume, C30ATAC is the 3rd moment
c     loss rate due to intermodal coagulation, MASSn is the mass
c     concentration of species n, and M3 is the 3rd moment
c     concentration.

      LOSS =  C30ATAC / CBLK( VAT3 )

C *** Calculates the partitioning of inorganic components (CL,NO3,NH4,SO4)
C     between the aerosol and gas phase over the operator synchronization
C     timestep (DT). Partitioning is calculated using the Hybrid approach,
C     where dynamic mass transfer of species to/from the coarse mode is
C     calculated using multiple sub-operator time steps (TSTEP) and the
C     fine modes are equilibrated with the gas phase. The mass transfer
C     calculations are made using the H+ flux-limiting approach of Pilinis
C     et al. (2000). If 'OPTIONFLAG' is not set to 'Hybrid', the mass
C     transfer calculations for the coarse mode are skipped, and the fine
C     modes are equilibrated with the gas phase.

C     Returns updated volatile inorganic species concentrations in the gas
C     and particulate phase, and the aerosol modal parameters
