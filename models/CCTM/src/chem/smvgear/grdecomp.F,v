       SUBROUTINE DECOMP

C***********************************************************************
C
C  FUNCTION:  To decompose the matrix [P] into lower- and upper
C             triangular form to facilitate solution of the set of 
C             linear simultaneous equations of the form [A]{x}={b}.

C  REVISION HISTORY: Prototype created by Jerry Gipson, June, 1995.
C                      Based on  the code originally developed by 
C                      M. Jacobson, (Atm. Env., Vol 28, No 2, 1994).
C                    Revised 3/14/96 by Jerry Gipson to conform to
C                      the Models-3 minimum IOV configuration
C                    Revised December 1996 by Jerry Gipson to conform
C                      to the Models-3 interim CTM that includes emissions
C                      in chemistry.
C                    Modified June, 1997 by Jerry Gipson to be consistent
C                      with beta CTM
C                    Modified September, 1997 by Jerry Gipson to be
C                      consistent with the targetted CTM
C                    16 Aug 01 J.Young: Use HGRD_DEFN
