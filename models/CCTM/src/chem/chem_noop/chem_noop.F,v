C***********************************************************************
C   Portions of Models-3/CMAQ software were developed or based on      *
C   information from various groups: Federal Government employees,     *
C   contractors working on a United States Government contract, and    *
C   non-Federal sources (including research institutions).  These      *
C   research institutions have given the Government permission to      *
C   use, prepare derivative works, and distribute copies of their      *
C   work in Models-3/CMAQ to the public and to permit others to do     *
C   so.  EPA therefore grants similar permissions for use of the       *
C   Models-3/CMAQ software, but users are requested to provide copies  *
C   of derivative works to the Government without restrictions as to   *
C   use by others.  Users are responsible for acquiring their own      *
C   copies of commercial software associated with Models-3/CMAQ and    *
C   for complying with vendor requirements.  Software copyrights by    *
C   the MCNC Environmental Modeling Center are used with their         *
C   permissions subject to the above restrictions.                     *

      SUBROUTINE CHEM ( CGRID, JDATE, JTIME, TSTEP )

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Function:  
C   VGASCHEM is the driver for the vectorized gas phase chemistry
C   calculations. 
C
C Revision History: 
C   prototype by Rohit Mathur, March, 1993
C   major mods, Jeff Young, April, 1994
C   Some argument data are interpolated data and have not been stride-
C   offset in their leading dimension (July, 1994)
C   31 Mar 01 J.Young: generic CGRID declaration
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

      IMPLICIT NONE

C Includes:    

!     INCLUDE SUBST_HGRD_ID     ! horizontal dimensioning parameters
!     INCLUDE SUBST_VGRD_ID     ! vertical dimensioning parameters
      INCLUDE SUBST_IODECL      ! I/O definitions and declarations

C Arguments:
     
!     REAL      :: CGRID( :,:,:,: ) !  concentrations
      REAL, POINTER :: CGRID( :,:,:,: ) !  concentrations
      INTEGER      JDATE        ! current model date, coded YYYYDDD
      INTEGER      JTIME        ! current model time, coded HHMMSS
