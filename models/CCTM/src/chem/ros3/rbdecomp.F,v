C***********************************************************************
C
C  FUNCTION:  To decompose the matrix [A] into lower- and upper
C             triangular form to facilitate solution of the set of 
C             linear simultaneous equations of the form [A]{x}={b}.

C  REVISION HISTORY: Prototype created by Jerry Gipson, August, 2004.
C                      Based on the SMVGEAR code originally developed by 
C                      M. Jacobson, (Atm. Env., Vol 28, No 2, 1994).
