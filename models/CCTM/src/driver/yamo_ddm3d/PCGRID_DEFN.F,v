      MODULE PCGRID_DEFN

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Function:
C   Create CGRID target, PCGRID. CGRID becomes a pointer to enable a one-
C   cell ghost region around CGRID

C Preconditions:
C   Horizontal domain extents must be set (subroutine PAR_INIT -> HGRD_DEFN)
C   Number of species in the species groups must be available (include files
C   in CGRID_SPCS)
C   This module is referenced in driver and sciproc. driver must call HGRD_INIT,
C   CGRID_MAP, and PAR_INIT prior to calling PCGRID_INIT (below).

C Subroutines and functions called:

C Revision history:
C   Apr 00 - Al, David, Jeff - initial implementation
C   Dec 00 - Jeff - add CGRID_MAP "method"
C   Jan 01 - Jeff - remove CGRID_MAP "method" - now in module CGRID_SPCS
C   Nov 01 - Jeff - correct pointer reference for ping
C   Dec 04 - Jeff - dyn alloc - USE VGRD_DEFN
C   Jan 05 - Jeff - dyn alloc - establish both horizontal & vertical
C                   domain specifications in one module
