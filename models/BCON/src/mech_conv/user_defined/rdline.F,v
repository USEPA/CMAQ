C   Portions of Models-3/CMAQ software were developed or based on      *

      SUBROUTINE RDLINE
C***********************************************************************
C
C  FUNCTION: RDLINE reads one line from a file and stores it in INBUF.
C            The position of the last non-blank character is stored
C            in IEOL. All blank lines and lines with a ! in the first
C            column are skipped. The line count is stored in LINNUM.
