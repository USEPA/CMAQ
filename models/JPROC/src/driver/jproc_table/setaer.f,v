      SUBROUTINE SETAER ( NWL, MIDWL, AAER, OMAER, GAER, HAER )

C*********************************************************************
C
C  Specify aerosols
C
C    AAER(IWL) = aerosol total vertical optical depth variation with
C                wavelength.  Estimated from Elterman (1968)
C    AER(I)    = attenuation (per km) profile from Elterman (1968).
C                Given in data statement in beginning of code,
C                for 340 nm (IWL=60)
C                Same vertical shape at all wavelengths.
C                Normalized later (in subroutine SUBGRID) to total
C                vertical dep this wavelength.
C    OMAER     = aerosol single scattering albedo.  Use 0.99 for now.
C    GAER      = aerosol asymetry factor.  Use 0.61 (Hansen and
C                Travis 1974) (these are assuming particles of
C                about 0.1 micron radius index of refraction of
C                about 1.65 + 0.002i.
C    HAER      = the aerosol scale height at top of atmosphere
C                use equal to air (8.05 km)
