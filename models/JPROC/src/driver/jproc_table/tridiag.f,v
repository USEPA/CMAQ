      SUBROUTINE TRIDIAG ( A, B, E, D, U, N )
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C
C  FUNCTION:
C    Solves tridiagonal system by Thomas algorithm.  Algorithm fails
C    if first pivot is zero.  In that case, rewrite the
C    equation as a set of order N-1, with U(2) trivially eliminated.
C The associated tri-diagonal system is stored in 3 arrays
C   B: diagonal
C   A: sub-diagonal
C   E: super-diagonal
C   D: right hand side function
C   U : return solution from tridiagonal solver
C
C     [ B(1) E(1) 0    0    0 ...       0     ]
C     [ A(2) B(2) E(2) 0    0 ...       .     ]
C     [ 0    A(3) B(3) E(3) 0 ...       .     ]
C     [ .       .     .     .           .     ] U(i) = D(i)
