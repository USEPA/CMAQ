********************************************************************************
Announcing the release of MCIP Version 5.5 (19 September 2024)
********************************************************************************

The MCIP code is updated to version 5.5.  This is a minor update to MCIP.
These release notes and the CHANGES file reflect all changes that have been
made to MCIP since MCIPv5.4 (the previous release).  Changes to MCIPv5.5
were made by Tanya Spero (U.S. EPA).

MCIPv5.5 accompanies CMAQv5.5.  If you are using CMAQv5.3+, you must
upgrade to use MCIPv5.0+.

MCIPv5.5 requires I/O API version 3.1 or greater to support error-checking
within the I/O API.

MCIPv5.5 requires the netCDF F90 module (rather than the F77 include).

A DOI will also be available for CMAQv5.5 (which includes MCIPv5.5).


Background on MCIP and other useful information about the CMAQ system can be

Inquiries related to potential bugs in MCIPv5.5 for questions related to
proper use of the code should be submitted to the MCIP Category in the
Forum hosted by the CMAS Center:  https://forum.cmascenter.org/c/mcip.

Users are encouraged to read the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) file.
Users should consult the FAQ and other issues raised within the Forum
before submitting new inquiries.



MCIPv5.5 was tested with the following Fortran compilers under both debug
and optimized options (as shown in the Makefile):

  Intel 21.4 with netCDF 4.9.2 and I/O API 3.2

  Nvidia 22.11 with netCDF 4.9.2 and I/O API 3.2

  GCC 8.5.0 with netCDF 4.9.2 and I/O API 3.2



With MCIPv5.5, the following remain deprecated:
  - Including "SOIM1", "SOIM2", "SOIT1", and "SOIT2" in METCRO2D.
    Those fields are now in a separate file that includes all soil layers and
    their associated depths (SOI_CRO).
  - Including "LUFRAC_xx" in GRIDCRO2D.  Those fields are now in a separate
    file that includes each fractional land use classification (LUFRAC_CRO).

With MCIPv5.5, the following output variables in METCRO2D remain deprecated:
     - 2-D cloud fraction (CFRAC)
     - cloud top (CLDT)
     - cloud bottom (CLDB)
     - liquid water content (WBAR)
They will be removed from METCRO2D in a forthcoming release of MCIP.


Interactions with members of the CMAQ user community led to some of the changes
that have been incorporated into MCIPv5.5.


The following is a summary of the changes in MCIPv5.5:

 1.  Changed constraint on XORIG and YORIG for Lambert conformal projections
     with user-specified runtime reference latitude. Original constraint of
     500 meters introduced an error in calculating the location of the
     lower-left corner (i.e., XORIG and YORIG) in domains with a horizontal
     grid spacing that is not a multiple of 1 km. Now using a constraint of
     5 meters to allow for "neater" XORIG and YORIG values across compilers.

 2.  Updated WRF option translation for the MCIP metadata for new physics
     introduced between WRFv4.1 and WRFv4.6.

 3.  Removed a redundant NF90_OPEN/NF90_CLOSE couplet to improve efficiency.
