Community Multiscale Air Quality Model [US EPA Website](https://www.epa.gov/air-research/community-multi-scale-air-quality-cmaq-modeling-system-air-quality-management)

CMAQ is an active open-source development project of the U.S. EPA Computational Exposure Division
that consists of a suite of programs for conducting air quality model simulations.
CMAQ is supported by the CMAS Center (http://www.cmascenter.org).

CMAQ combines current knowledge in atmospheric science and air quality modeling with multi-processor
computing techniques in an open-source framework to deliver fast, technically sound estimates of ozone,
particulates, toxics, and acid deposition.

The CMAQ Git repository is organized with each official public release stored as a branch on the public GitHub USEPA CMAQ repository.
To clone code from the CMAQ Git repository, specify the branch (i.e. version number) and issue the following command from within a working directory on your server. For example, toget the 5.2Beta version in a local repository that you've named CMAQ_v5.2Beta:
```
git clone -b 5.2Beta https://github.com/USEPA/CMAQ.git CMAQ_v5.2Beta
```
The release versions of CMAQ that are currently available on Git Hub include:

* [v5.2Beta (October 2016)](https://github.com/USEPA/CMAQ/tree/5.2Beta)
* [v5.1   (December 2015)](https://github.com/USEPA/CMAQ/tree/5.1)
* [v5.0.2 (April 2014)](https://github.com/USEPA/CMAQ/tree/5.0.2)
* [v5.0.1 (July 2012)](https://github.com/USEPA/CMAQ/tree/5.0.1)
* [v5.0   (February 2012)](https://github.com/USEPA/CMAQ/tree/5.0)
* [v4.7.1 (June 2010)](https://github.com/USEPA/CMAQ/tree/4.7.1)

Benchmark/tutorial input and output data for each CMAQ release version are available from the CMAS Center Software Clearinghouse. From http://www.cmascenter.org, select Download -> Software -> CMAQ and choose the version to get the tutorial data.
