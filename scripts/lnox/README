These are scripts for generating lightning NOx input files for CMAQv5.0.


If you have the NLDN dataset and need to build monthly average strike density

1. build the program src/NLDN_2D using Makefile.NLDN_2D

2. run the script run.NLDN_2D.sh

3. copy the output to $M3DATA/raw/lnox/flash_data/monthly_flash_density


If you have the NLDN gridded monthly average strike density and need to build the parameter file for CMAQv5.0 (ocean mask, ICCG, and NLDN adjustment factors):

1. build the program src/LTNG_2D_DATA

2. run the script run.LTNG_2D.sh

3. compare against the results in the $M3DATA/ref/lnox directory
