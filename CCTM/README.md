CMAQ Chemistry Transport Model (CCTM)
========

##Overview
CCTM is the Eulerian chemistry and transport component of CMAQ. It uses input data produced by the other CMAQ programs and from meteorological and emissions models. CCTM produces multiple output files for each simulation. The basic CCTM outputs include instantaneous and average hourly concentration files, wet and dry deposition files, and visibility estimates. Other CCTM outputs can include diagnostic aerosol and cloud files and processes analysis files.

CCTM contains several science configurations for simulating transport, chemistry, and deposition. All of the science configuration options in CCTM, such as the chemical mechanism to be used, are set when compiling the executable. The model grid and vertical layer structure for CCTM are set at execution. The important distinction between selecting the science configuration and the model grid/layer configuration is that CCTM does not need to be recompiled when changing model grids/layers but does need to be recompiled when new science options are invoked.

Optional output files are created when their associated processes are invoked in CCTM. For example, when CCTM is compiled with process analysis turned on, additional output files are created.

CCTM includes options for the in-line processing of emissions and photolysis rates. In-line refers to the handling of processes that had previously been accomplished outside of CCTM, such as emissions processing with SMOKE, with algorithms internal to CCTM. The benefits of in-line emissions processing include the integration of higher time-resolution meteorology in the computation of biogenic emissions and plume rise from point sources and the avoidance of the large data storage burden required for emissions data. The benefit of in-line photolysis rate calculations is the inclusion of predicted gas and aerosol concentrations in the rate calculations.

Both in-line emissions and photolysis are invoked through compile-time configuration options for CCTM. When CCTM is instrumented for in-line emissions calculations, a series of additional input files and environment variables are required at execution. The details of these additional inputs are provided below. In-line photolysis does not require any additional inputs as CCTM includes all of the photolysis rate data internal to the in-line instrumented version of the model.
