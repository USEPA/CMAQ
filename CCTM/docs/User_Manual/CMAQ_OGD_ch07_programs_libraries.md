Overview
--------

The core CMAQ programs that are needed to perform a basic air quality model simulation are [MCIP](#mcip), [ICON](#icon), [BCON](#bcon), [JPROC](#jproc), and [CCTM](#cctm). The relationships among these programs are depicted within the green box in [Figure 7-1](#Figure7-1). The blue boxes represent programs that are not part of the CMAQ distribution package but supply data necessary for an air quality simulation (emissions and meteorology data). The yellow boxes represent the standard CMAQ preprocessors: MCIP, ICON, BCON, and JPROC. The red box represents the CMAQ chemistry-transport model (CCTM), the Eulerian air quality modeling component of CMAQ. Data flows between the CMAQ programs are represented in by arrows. The red arrows illustrate the flow of data from the CMAQ preprocessors and the emissions model to CCTM. The green arrows show the data feedbacks from CCTM to create initial and boundary conditions for nested simulations. The black arrow illustrates the connection between the meteorological model and MCIP. Finally, the blue arrow shows that the output from MCIP can be used to drive an emissions model.

A meteorological model,such as [WRF‑ARW](http://www.wrf-model.org), generates gridded meteorology for input to both CMAQ and the emissions model. These data are processed for input to CMAQ using MCIP.

An emissions model converts emissions inventories to gridded, hourly emissions formatted for CMAQ. The [SMOKE](http://www.smoke-model.org) emissions model is currently available for preparing emissions data for CMAQ.

CMAQ includes several "in-line" options to support coupling between meteorology and chemistry processes, and to facilitate operational air quality forecast modeling (see [Chapter 4](CMAQ_OGD_ch04_science.md)). The user can incorporate photolysis rate calculations and emissions processing during a CCTM simulation. There are several advantages of incorporating these processes directly in a CCTM simulation:

1. Photolysis rate calculations use the aerosol concentrations and meteorology from the CCTM simulation, simulating the feedbacks of the input emissions and resulting air quality on photochemistry
2. Emissions are meteorologically modulated at the synchronization (chemistry) time step rather than being linearly time-interpolated within each simulation hour
3. Disk space may be saved, because a 3‑D emissions file is no longer needed for elevated point sources
4. CMAQ can more easily be coupled with a meteorological model, enabling direct emissions modulation by the underlying, freshly computed meteorological variables

[MCIP](#mcip) is the first program in the CMAQ distribution package that a user should run when setting up a new simulation. MCIP is used to preprocess the data from a meteorological model for CMAQ and SMOKE.

[ICON](#icon) creates a binary netCDF initial conditions file for input to CCTM. Users have the option to create initial conditions data either from a text file of vertical concentration profiles or from an existing CCTM output file. ICON outputs initial conditions data that are configured for a specific modeling grid and chemical parameterization.

[BCON](#bcon) creates a binary netCDF lateral boundary conditions file for input to CCTM. Users have the option to create boundary conditions from either a text file of vertical concentration profiles or from an existing CCTM or larger-scale (e.g., global-scale) output file. BCON outputs boundary conditions data that are configured for a specific modeling grid and chemical parameterization. If derived from an existing CCTM or larger-scale output file, BCON produces dynamic boundary conditions that vary in time and space. When derived from vertical concentration profiles, BCON produces static boundary conditions for input to CCTM.

[JPROC](#jproc) converts physical information about photoreactive molecules into clear-sky photolysis rate look-up tables for input to CCTM. The in-line photolysis approach allows photolysis rates to be adjusted by simulated gas and aerosol concentrations rather than by climatological values in the off-line approach. JPROC is not required when the in-line photolysis approach is selected.

[CCTM](#cctm) is run last in the sequence of programs. All of the other CMAQ programs, and the emissions and meteorological models, are used to prepare the inputs to CCTM. By using data that are synchronized for a particular modeling time period, model grid, vertical layer configuration, and chemical parameterization, CCTM can produce estimates of pollutant concentrations, wet and dry deposition rates, and visibility metrics.

In addition to the core programs shown in [Figure 7‑1](#Figure7-1), the CMAQ distribution package also includes utilities `($CMAQ_HOME/UTIL/)` and post-processors `($CMAQ_HOME/POST/)` for utilizing additional technical and diagnostic features in CMAQ. The CMAQ utility programs [CHEMMECH](#chemmech) [CSV2NML](#chemmech), [CREATE_EBI](#create_ebi), and [INLINE_PHOT_PREPROC](#inline_phot_preproc) are used to modify or prepare new chemical mechanisms for CMAQ. The CMAQ preprocessor [CALMAP](#calmap) creates maps of the crop calendar for use in estimating windblown dust emissions. The CMAQ post-processors are described in the [CMAQv5.1 documentation](https://www.airqualitymodeling.org/index.php/CMAQv5.1_Tools_and_Utilities) and are used to prepare CMAQ output data for analysis.

This chapter provides detailed descriptions of the CMAQ programs and utilities. Information about the third-party libraries used by CMAQ—such as I/O API, netCDF, and MPI are available in [Chapter 6](CMAQ_OGD_ch06_req_lib.md). When viewing the tables that list each program’s input and output files, recall that the various I/O API file formats shown are also described in [Chapter 6](CMAQ_OGD_ch06_req_lib.md).

## BCON

### Description

The program BCON prepares lateral chemical boundary conditions (BCs) for CCTM from either ASCII vertical profiles or from an existing CCTM output concentration (CONC) file. The BCs created by BCON can be static in both time and space (i.e., time-invariant with uniform concentrations in all boundary grid cells), dynamic in both time and space, or a combination of the two. The ASCII vertical profiles are primarily used to create static BCs. Dynamic BCs can be extracted from CONC files on either the same horizontal grid spacing (i.e., as a windowed modeling domain) or for a finer-resolution model grid (i.e., for a nested simulation), or they can be interpolated from a larger-scale CTM simulation (which is analogous to defining lateral BCs for WRF‑ARW).

There are two distinct modes of operation for BCON, and the mode used depends on the nature of the input data. When creating BCON executables, the user must specify whether the input data will be ASCII vertical profiles or a CONC file by selecting either “profile” or “m3conc”, respectively, for the setting of the *ModType* variable. This variable determines the input module to use when creating a BCON executable.

CCTM can also be forced with chemical boundary conditions downscaled from global chemistry models (GCMs), such as GEOS-Chem and MOZART. BCON does not support the processing of data from GCMs. BCs derived from GCMs must be calculated with custom codes or scripts that are not available in the CMAQ distribution package. The CAMx developers (Ramboll Environ) have codes available for extracting regional model BCs from both GEOS-Chem and MOZART. Visit the [Support Software section of www.CAMx.com](http://www.camx.com/download/support-software.aspx) to download these utilities.

### Files, configuration, and environment variables ###

[Figure 7‑2](#Figure7-2) shows the input and output files and configuration options for BCON. A distinction is made between the options that are invoked at compilation versus those invoked at execution of the program. When compiling BCON, the user specifies a chemical mechanism to configure the gas-phase chemistry and aerosol mechanism used to create the chemical BCs. Setting the *ModMech* and *Mechanism* variables in the BCON compile script configures the program to use a specific set of mechanism INCLUDE files to build an executable. Setting the *ModType* variable in the BCON compile script configures the program to input either a text file of static concentrations or a binary netCDF file of time-dependent concentrations for estimating BCs for CCTM. Separate BCON executables must be prepared for different mechanism and input file configurations.

<a id=Figure7-2></a>

**Figure 7‑2. BCON input and output files**</center>

<br>
When BCON is run, it converts a data file of chemical ambient concentrations to BCs on a predefined model grid. Through the specification of the *ModInpt* variable in the BCON run script, BCON will input either an ASCII vertical profile file (BC_PROFILE) or an existing CCTM concentration file (CTM_CONC_1); the choice depends on how the user compiled the model. The BC input file provided by the user must have chemical speciation that is consistent with the mechanism configuration of the BCON executable. For example, if BCON was compiled to create BCs using the CB05 mechanism, the input BC profile data must be in terms of the CB05 mechanism. CMAQ is distributed with ASCII vertical profiles representing clean continental BCs for North America for the following chemical mechanisms: cb05e51_ae6_aq, saprc07tb_ae6_aq and racm2_aq6_aq. It is the user’s responsibility to generate BC inputs for other mechanism configurations.

The horizontal grid and vertical layer structures for BCON are defined at execution through the input of a grid description (GRIDDESC) file and a meteorology cross-point 3‑D (MET_CRO_3D) file, respectively. BCON interpolates between the input vertical layer structure and output layer structure if they are different.

#### BCON input files ####

<a id=Table7-2></a>

<center>**Table 7‑2. BCON output files**</center>

|**File Name**|**Format**|**Description**|
|---|---|---|
|`BNDY_CONC_1`|`BNDARY3`|Name and location of the gridded boundary conditions data output on the model grid defined by `GRID_NAME`|

The default location of the BCON output files is the `$CMAQ_DATA/bcon` directory, controlled by the `OUTDIR` variable in the run script. The default naming convention for all BCON output files uses the `APPL` and `GRID_NAME` environment variables in the file name. For boundary conditions created from existing `CCTM CONC` files, the Julian date is also used in the file name through the `DATE` environment variable. All of the file-naming variables for `BCON` outputs are set in the run script.

#### Compilation Configuration Variables ####

The configuration options listed here are set during compilation of the BCON executable. When these options are invoked they create a binary executable that is fixed to the specified configuration. To change these options you must recompile BCON and create a new executable.

-   `CopySrc`<br>
    Uncomment to copy the source code into a working build (BLD) directory. If commented, onlhy the compiled object and executable files will be placed in the BLD directory.

-   `MakeFileOnly`<br>
    Uncomment to build a Makefile to compile the executable. Comment out to both create a Makefile and compile.

-   `ModType: [default: module profile]`<br>
    Defines the format of the boundary conditions input files to be used by BCON.
    -   `m3conc`: input a CCTM CONC file; used for nested simulations or windows of a parent domain
    -   `profile`: input an ASCII vertical profiles file
    -   `tracer`: use the tracer namelist file to create BCs of tagged tracer species


-  `Mechanism: [default: cb05e51_ae6_aq]`<br>
    Specifies the gas-phase, aerosol, and aqueous-phase chemical mechanisms for which to create boundary conditions. The choices for the *Mechanism* variable are the mechanism directory names under the `$CMAQ_HOME/CCTM/src/MECHS` directory. Also see the [Mechanism Definitions Table](../Release_Notes/CMAQv5.2_Mechanisms.md)). Examples include:
    -   `cb6r3_ae6_aq`: CB6, revision 3 gas-phase mechanism, sixth-generation CMAQ aerosol mechanism with sea salt and speciated PM Other, aqueous/cloud chemistry

-   `Tracer [default trac0] `<br>
    Specifies tracer species. Invoking inert tracer species in CMAQ requires defining the tracers using namelist files and compiling the CMAQ programs with these files. The setting for this module corresponds to the directory name in the $CMAQ_HOME/CCTM/src/MECHS directory that contains the namelist files for the tracer configuration. The default setting is to not use any tracers.

### Compiling and Running ###

#### Compile BCON ####

[Chapter 5](CMAQ_OGD_ch05_sys_req.md) provides an overview of how to install and compile the CMAQ pre-processor programs for a test simulation. Follow those steps (summarized below) to compile new versions of BCON.

1. Compile Bldmake, the CMAQ source code and compilation management program. This needs to be done only once—the first time CMAQ is installed.
-   Configure the BCON use the config.cmaq script, which points to the available I/O API and netCDF libraries.
-   Configure the BCON build script for your application by setting the compilation configuration variables described above.
-   Invoke the build script to create an executable:

`cd $CMAQ_HOME/PREP/bcon/scripts/`<br>
`./bldit.bcon |& tee build.bcon.log`

#### Run BCON ####

Set the run script settings according to the execution configuration variables described above. Run BCON to produce boundary conditions for the CCTM:

`cd $CMAQ_HOME/PREP/BCON`<br>
`./run.bcon |& tee bcon.log`

<a id="Calmap"></a>
## Calmap

### Description

The preprocessor program Calmap produces gridded planting start dates, planting end dates, and harvesting end dates for different crop types for estimating the impacts of agricultural activities on windblown dust emissions. The CMAQ windblown dust emissions module can optionally use the output from Calmap to simulate the effects of crop cycles on dust emissions.

### Files, configuration, and environment variables

Figure 7-3 shows that Calmap reads five input files to produce eight outputs, only three of which are used by the CCTM. Calmap uses the GRIDCRO2D file, produced by MCIP, to define the modeling grid. The BELD01 file points to a BELD3 “a” file of gridded land cover/land use data containing coverage for several different crop categories. The BELD3 “a” file is an input to the BEIS emissions model and can be [generated by the Spatial Allocator](https://github.com/CMASCenter/Spatial-Allocator/blob/master/docs/User_Manual/SA_ch03_vector.md#5-creating-inputs-to-smoke-biogenic-processing). The rest of the inputs to Calmap are crop calendar data for the United States that are packaged with CMAQv5. Calmap converts to the data to I/O API GRDDED3 files on the modeling grid defined in the GRIDCRO2D file. The CROPMAP01 file contains planting start dates for specific crops. The CROPMAP04 file contains planting end dates for specific crops. The CROPMAP08 file contains harvesting end dates for specific crops. Each of these files are input to the CCTM when the erodible agricultural land (CTM_ERODE_AGLAND) feature is turned on.

### Compiling and Running

#### Compile Calmap

Calmap is compiled with a Makefile. The configuration options in the Makefile include only the compiler and compiler flags to use for building the executable. The Makefile is located in the directory with the Calmap source code (`$CMAQ_HOME/PREP/agdust/src`). To compile Calmap, source the config.cmaq file and invoke the Makefile at the command line:

`cd $CMAQ_HOME/PREP/agdust/src/`<br>
`source $CMAQ_HOME/config.cmaq`<br>
`./make |& tee make.calmap.log`

To port Calmap to different compilers, change the compiler names, locations, and flags in the config.cmaq script.


#### Run Calmap ####

Set the run script settings according to the execution configuration variables described above. Run Calmap to produce crop calendar input for the CCTM inline windblown dust model:

`cd $CMAQ_HOME/PREP/agdust`<br>
`./run.calmap |& tee run.calmap.log`

<a id="CCTM"></a>
## CCTM

### Description

CCTM is the Eulerian chemistry and transport component of CMAQ. It uses input data produced by the other CMAQ programs and from meteorological and emissions models. CCTM produces multiple output files for each simulation. The basic CCTM outputs include instantaneous and average hourly concentration files, wet and dry deposition files, and visibility estimates. Other CCTM outputs can include diagnostic aerosol and cloud files and processes analysis files.

CCTM contains several science configurations for simulating transport, chemistry, and deposition. All of the science configuration options in CCTM, such as the chemical mechanism to be used, are set when compiling the executable. The model grid and vertical layer structure for CCTM are set at execution. The important distinction between selecting the science configura­tion and the model grid/layer configuration is that CCTM does not need to be recompiled when changing model grids/layers but does need to be recompiled when new science options are invoked.

Optional output files are created when their associated processes are invoked in CCTM. For example, when CCTM is compiled with process analysis turned on, additional output files are created.

CCTM includes options for the in-line processing of emissions and photolysis rates. In-line refers to the handling of processes that had previously been accomplished outside of CCTM, such as emissions processing with SMOKE, with algorithms internal to CCTM. The benefits of in-line emissions processing include the integration of higher time-resolution meteorology in the computation of biogenic emissions and plume rise from point sources and the avoidance of the large data storage burden required for emissions data. The benefit of in-line photolysis rate calculations is the inclusion of predicted gas and aerosol concentrations in the rate calculations.

Both in-line emissions and photolysis are invoked through compile-time configuration options for CCTM. When CCTM is instrumented for in-line emissions calculations, a series of additional input files and environment variables are required at execution. The details of these additional inputs are provided below. In-line photolysis does not require any additional inputs as CCTM includes all of the photolysis rate data internal to the in-line instrumented version of the model.

### Files, configuration, and environment variables

[Figure 7‑4](#Figure7-4) shows the input and output files and configuration options for CCTM. A distinction is made between the options that are invoked at compilation time versus those invoked at execution of the program. When compiling CCTM, the user specifies a chemical mechanism to configure the gas-phase chemistry and aerosol mechanism used for the air quality calculations. Setting the *Mechanism* variable in CCTM compile script configures the program to use a specific set of mechanism INCLUDE files to build an executable. All of the science processes simulated by CCTM must also be selected during the compilation step for CCTM. Separate CCTM executables must be prepared for different mechanism and science configurations. During the execution step, or when CCTM is run, the user sets the horizontal and vertical grid definitions and the input files used for the simulation. Different spatial domains, vertical grid structures and input files can be used with a single CCTM executable, as long as the input files are consistent with the scientific configuration built into the executable. For example, with the gas-phase photochemical mechanism configuration built into a CCTM executable, different modeling domains can be simulated with the executable as long as the emissions and IC/BC files are consistent with the photochemical mechanism configuration built into the executable.

#### Compilation Configuration Variables

The configuration options listed here are set during compilation of the CCTM executable. When these options are invoked they create a binary executable that is fixed to the specified configuration. To change these options you must recompile CCTM and create a new executable.

Several of the CCTM science modules have more than one option.  Brief descriptions of these options are provided here.  For details on the science of the different options refer to the [CMAQ Release Notes](../Release_Notes/README.md).

The following five options are invoked by uncommenting the line in the CCTM build script.  Comment the line in the script using a "#" to turn the option off.

-   `CopySrc`<br>
    Uncomment to copy the source code into a working build (BLD) directory. If commented, onlhy the compiled object and executable files will be placed in the BLD directory.

-   `set ParOpt`<br>
    Build an executable for running on multiple processors. Invoking this command requires the availability of the MPI library/INCLUDE files.

-   `MakeFileOnly`<br>
    Uncomment to build a Makefile to compile the executable. Comment out to both create a Makefile and compile.

-   `set build_parallel_io`<br>
     Uncomment to build CMAQ with true parallel I/O feature (requires ioapi3.2 and pnetcdf)

### Compiling and Running

#### Compile CCTM ####

[Chapter 5](CMAQ_OGD_ch05_sys_req.md) provides an overview of how to install and compile the CMAQ pre-processor programs for a test simulation. Follow those steps (summarized below) to compile new versions of CCTM.

1. Compile Bldmake, the CMAQ source code and compilation management program. This needs to be done only once—the first time CMAQ is installed.
-   Configure the CCTM build script to use the config.cmaq script, which points to the available I/O API and netCDF libraries.
-   Configure the CCTM build script for your application by setting the compilation configuration variables described above.
-   Invoke the build script to create an executable:

`cd $CMAQ_HOME/CCTM/scripts`<br>
`./bldit.cctm |& tee build.cctm.log`

#### Run CCTM ####

Set the run script settings according to the execution configuration variables described above. Run CCTM using the following command:

`cd $CMAQ_HOME/CCTM/scripts`<br>
`./run.cctm |& tee run.cctm.log`

## CHEMMECH and CSV2NML

### Description

The program CHEMMECH generates mechanism source code files for all chemical mechanism-dependent CMAQ programs. Using an ASCII mechanism definition file as input, the Fortran program CHEMMECH creates all of the Fortran files that define the gas-phase chemical mechanisms for the CMAQ programs. The C-Shell script CSV2NML converts a comma-delimited text file that defines the processes (e.g., input as emissions, input through boundary conditions, transport, deposition) impacting the concentrations of each model species to a NAMELIST file for input to the CMAQ programs. In combination the Fortran source and NAMELIST files define chemical mechanisms in the CMAQ programs.

Implementing new mechanisms created by CHEMMECH and CSV2NML in the CMAQ programs is a two-step process. CHEMMECH generates the mechanism RXNS source files that must be used in the compilation of CMAQ source code into an executable. CSV2NML generates species NAMELIST files that are input to the CMAQ programs during execution. Care must be taken to ensure that the RXNS and NAMELIST files are consistent with each other in order to correctly update or implement new mechanisms in CMAQ.

CHEMMECH reads in a mechanism definition (mech.def) text file that lists the stoichiometry and kinetics of a photochemical reaction mechanism. The program converts the mech.def file to two RXNS files, RXNS_DATA_MODULE.F90 and RXNS_FUNC_MODULE.F90 that get compiled with the CMAQ source code into a new executable. The source files created by CHEMMECH must be manually moved to the correct directory location in the CMAQ source code directories to be available during compilation of the CMAQ programs. The mechanism files for CMAQ are found in $CMAQ_HOME/CCTM/src/MECHS/$Mechanism, where $Mechanism is the unique ID of a chemical mechanism (e.g., cb05e51_aq6_aq).

CSV2NML reads in a series of CSV files that define the processes that impact the concentrations of all of the CMAQ species. The CSV files are converted to NAMELIST files that are invoked at execution of the various CMAQ programs. Environment variables in the run scripts for ICON, BCON, and CCTM must be set to point to the NAMELIST files for a particular mechanism.

See [Chapter 9](CMAQ_OGD_ch09_grid_defn.md) for details on how to update existing mechanisms or create new mechanisms in CMAQ.

### Files, configuration, and environment variables

[Figure 7‑5](#Figure5-4) shows the input and output files and configuration options for CHEMMECH and CSV2NML. The full set of mechanism files required by the CMAQ programs is generated in two steps. In the first step, the program CHEMMECH is run with the mechanism definition file, mech.def, provided as input. The resulting RXNS files are then input to the CMAQ build scripts to compile CMAQ with a new chemical mechanism configuration. CSV2NML is used to convert the species definition files from CSV format to NAMELIST files. The NAMELIST files are used as inputs to the CMAQ programs ICON, BCON, or CCTM to define the processes that will impact each model species. Three NAMELIST files define the processes for gas-phase species (GC.nml), aerosol species (AE.nml), and nonreactive species (NR.nml).

<center>**Figure 7‑5. CHEMMECH and CSV2NML input and output files (Update this Image)**</center>

<br>
<p>To implement a new mechanism in CMAQ, start with a mechanism definition (mech.def) file and CSV species files from an existing mechanism in the model. Edit the mech.def file to include the new reactions, species, and reaction rates and provide this new mech.def file as input to CHEMMECH. Edit the CSV species files to include the new species and provide these files as input to CSV2NML. Detailed examples of updating an existing mechanism and adding a new mechanism to CMAQ are provided in [Chapter 9](CMAQ_OGD_ch09_grid_defn.md). Neither CHEMMECH nor CSV2NML requires horizontal grid, vertical layer, or temporal settings.</p>

<a id="CREATE_EBI"></a>
## CREATE_EBI

### Description

The program CREATE_EBI generates Fortran source code for the mechanism-dependent Euler Backward Iterative (EBI) solver. This utility program allows users to create new EBI solver code when mechanisms are modified or added to CMAQ. The source code generated by CREATE_EBI should be used to build versions of the CCTM that use the new or modified chemistry mechanisms.

See [Chapter 9](CMAQ_OGD_ch09_grid_defn.md)) for details on how to update existing mechanisms or create new mechanisms in CMAQ.

### Files, configuration, and environment variables

To implement a new mechanism in CMAQ, start with a mechanism definition (mech.def) file and CSV species files from an existing mechanism in the model. Edit the mech.def file to include the new reactions, species, and reaction rates and provide this new mech.def file as input to the program [CHEMMECH](#CHEMMECH). CHEMMECH will output a RXNS_DATA_MODULE.F90 file, which is used as input to CREATE_EBI.

## ICON


### Description

The program ICON prepares chemical initial conditions (ICs) for CCTM from either ASCII vertical profiles or from an existing CCTM output concentration (CONC) file. ICON creates an output file with a single time step that represents the chemical conditions in each grid cell at the beginning of a CCTM simulation. The ICs can be either spatially uniform or variable across the model grid, depending on the source of the initial chemical concentration data. If deriving ICs from the ASCII vertical profiles, ICON can create only spatially uniform ICs *within* each model layer; it can create different ICs *across* model layers. From CONC files, ICON can extract spatially varying ICs, either on the same grid cell resolution, as a windowed modeling domain, or for a finer-resolution model grid (as for a nested simulation).

There are two distinct modes of operation for ICON, depending on the nature of the input data. When creating ICON executables, the user must specify whether the input data will be ASCII vertical profiles or a CONC file by selecting either “profile” or “m3conc”, respectively, for the setting of the *ModType* variable. This variable determines the input module to use when creating an ICON executable.

CCTM can also be forced with initial conditions downscaled from global chemistry models (GCMs), such as GEOS-Chem and MOZART. ICON does not support the processing of data from GCMs. ICs derived from GCMs must be calculated with custom codes or scripts that are not available in the CMAQ distribution package. The CAMx developers (Ramboll Environ) have codes available for extracting regional model ICs from both GEOS-Chem and MOZART. Visit the [Support Software section of www.CAMx.com](http://www.camx.com/download/support-software.aspx) to download these utilities.

### Files, configuration, and environment variables ###

[Figure 7‑6](#Figure7-6) shows the input and output files and configuration options for ICON. A distinction is made between the options that are invoked at compilation versus those invoked at execution of the program. When compiling ICON, the user specifies a chemical mechanism to configure the gas-phase chemistry and aerosol mechanism used to create the chemical ICs. Setting the *ModMech* and *Mechanism* variables in the ICON compile script configures the program to use a specific set of mechanism namelist files to build an executable. Setting the *ModType* variable in the ICON compile script configures the program to input either a text file of static concentrations or a binary netCDF file of time-dependent concentrations for estimating ICs for CCTM. Separate ICON executables must be prepared for different mechanism and input file configurations.

<center>**Figure 7‑6. ICON input and output files**</center>

<br>
When ICON is run, it converts a data file of chemical ambient concentrations to ICs on a predefined model grid. Through the specification of the *ModType* variable in the ICON run script, ICON will input either an ASCII vertical profile file (IC_PROFILE) or an existing CCTM concentration file (CTM_CONC_1); the choice depends on how the user compiled the model. The IC input file provided by the user must have chemical speciation that is consistent with the mechanism configuration of the ICON executable. For example, if ICON was compiled to create ICs using the CB05 mechanism, the input IC profile data must be in terms of the CB05 mechanism. CMAQ is distributed with ASCII vertical profiles representing clean continental ICs for North America for the following chemical mechanisms: cb05_ae6_aq, saprc07tb_ae6_aq, racm2_aq6_aq, and saprc99_ae6_aq. It is the user’s responsibility to generate IC inputs for other mechanism configurations.

The horizontal grid and vertical layer structures for ICON are defined at execution through the input of a grid description (GRIDDESC) file and a meteorology cross-point 3‑D (MET_CRO_3D) file, respectively. ICON interpolates between the input vertical layer structure and output layer structure if they are different.

#### ICON input files ####

|**File Name**|**Format**|**Description**|
|---|---|---|
|INIT_CONC_1|`GRDDED3`|Name and location of the gridded initial conditions data output on the model grid defined by `GRID_NAME`|


The default location of the ICON output files is the `$CMAQ_DATA/icon` directory, controlled by the `OUTDIR` variable in the run script. The default naming convention for all ICON output files uses the `APPL` and `GRID_NAME` environment variables in the file name. For initial conditions created from existing `CCTM CONC` files, the Julian date is also used in the file name through the `DATE` environment variable. All of the file-naming variables for `ICON` outputs are set in the run script.

#### Compilation Configuration Variables ####

The configuration options listed here are set during compilation of the ICON executable. When these options are invoked they create a binary executable that is fixed to the specified configuration. To change these options you must recompile ICON and create a new executable.

<a id="INLINE_PHOT"></a>
## INLINE_PHOT_PREPROC

### Description

The program INLINE_PHOT_PREPROC generates absorption cross-section/quantum yield (CSQY) data files for the CCTM inline photolysis module. This utility program allows users to create new CSQY tables when reaction rate data are modified or added to CMAQ. The data tables generated by INLINE_PHOT_PREPROC should be used to create the photochemistry data tables needed for inline photolysis configurations of the CCTM.  

See [Chapter 9](CMAQ_OGD_ch09_grid_defn.md) for details on how to update existing mechanisms or create new mechanisms in CMAQ.

### Files, configuration, and environment variables

To implement new CSQY data in CMAQ, start with individual CSQY data files for each photolysis reaction in an applicable photochemical mechanism. Add to or modify these data to create the CCTM inline CSQY data table.

<a id="JPROC"></a>
## JPROC

### Description

The program JPROC calculates daily clear-sky photolysis rates from look-up tables of molecular absorption cross-section and quantum yield (CSQY) data, and climatologically derived ozone-column and optical depth data. The outputs from JPROC are ASCII look-up tables of daily clear-sky photolysis rates for photochemical reactions in a selected gas-phase photochemical mechanism at different altitudes, latitudes, and hours from noon. The photochemical mechanism from which these rates are derived is selected during compilation of JPROC. The altitudes (meters), latitudes (degrees), and hour angles (from noon) for which the rates are derived are hardwired in the JPROC source code.

CCTM includes an in-line photolysis option that calculates photolysis rates using predicted ozone and aerosols. JPROC is not needed if the in-line photolysis option is selected in CCTM (*ModPhot* set to inline). JPROC is required to produce daily photolysis rate look-up tables if CCTM is compiled with *ModPhot* set to table.

### Files, configuration, and environment variables

[Figure 7‑7](#Figure7-7) shows the input and output files for JPROC. Some options are invoked at compilation, while others are invoked with execution of the program. When compiling JPROC, the user specifies a chemical mechanism to indicate the gas-phase chemistry for which to calculate photolysis rates. Setting the *Mechanism* variable in the JPROC compile script configures the program to use a specific set of mechanism INCLUDE files to build an executable. JPROC executables are hard-wired to a specific mechanism configuration.

**Figure 7‑7. JPROC input and output files**

</center>
While JPROC does not require any technical configuration at execution, such as domain specifications, there are several required and optional input files that the user must provide to the program. For the selected photochemical mechanism, the user must provide a set of molecular absorption CSQY data files that are consistent with the photolysis reactions in the mechanism. CMAQ is distributed with a full set of CSQY files for the Carbon Bond, SAPRC, and RACM photochemical mechanism versions supported by the model. If new mechanisms are added to CMAQ, the user must produce the appropriate CSQY data files for the added mechanism. The user also has the option of using the default atmospheric profiles contained in the PROFILES input file or using Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) data to replace the climatologically derived ozone column data in the PROFILES file.

#### JPROC input files

The default location of the JPROC output files is the `$CMAQ_HOME/data/jproc` directory, controlled by the `OUTDIR` variable in the run script. The default naming convention for all JPROC output files uses the Date environment variable in the file name, which is aliased to the `STDATE` environment variable in the run script.

#### Compilation Configuration Variables

The configuration options listed here are set during compilation of the JPROC executable. When these options are invoked they create a binary executable that is fixed to the specified configuration. To change these options it is necessary to recompile JPROC and create a new executable.

-   `CopySrc`<br>
    Uncomment to copy the source code into a working build (BLD) directory. If commented, onlhy the compiled object and executable files will be placed in the BLD directory.

### Compiling and Running

#### JPROC compilation

[Chapter 5](CMAQ_OGD_ch05_sys_req.md) provides an overview of how to install and compile the CMAQ programs for the tutorial simulation. Follow the steps outlined in Chapter 5 (summarized below) to compile new versions of JPROC:

1.   Compile Bldmake, the CMAQ source code and compilation management program. This needs to be done only once—the first time CMAQ is installed.
-   Cnfigure the JPROC build script to use the config.cmaq script, which points to the available I/O API and netCDF libraries.
-   Configure the JPROC build script for your application by setting the compilation configuration variables described above.
-   Invoke the build script to create an executable:

`cd $CMAQ_HOME/PREP/jproc/scripts`
`./bldit.jproc |& tee build.jproc.log`

#### Run JPROC ####

Set the run script settings according to the execution configuration variables described above. Run JPROC to produce offline clear-sky photolysis rates for the CCTM:

`cd $CMAQ_HOME/PREP/jproc/scripts`<br>
`./run.jproc |& tee run.jproc.log`

LTNG_2D_DATA

### Description

Lightning is the largest source of nitrogen in the upper troposphere. NO<sub>x</sub> produced by lightning influences ambient nitrogen concentrations and wet deposition of total nitrates within the boundary layer. To simulate the impacts of lightning NO<sub>x</sub> emissions on ambient gas and particle concentrations and on deposition, CMAQv5 is instrumented with a lightning NO<sub>x</sub> module. CCTM can either read in an input file of lightning NO<sub>x</sub> emissions that were calculated off-line or it can compute lightning NO emissions in-line during a simulation. The in-line emissions can be calculated either directly from lightning flash counts estimated from the convective precipitation field in the input meteorology or by using a combination of observed flash counts and simulated convective precipitation. The former approach is recommended for hemispheric-scale simulations or when no flash count data are available, while the latter approach is recommended for all simulations at less than 50-km horizontal grid resolutions. The [National Lightning Detection Network](http://gcmd.nasa.gov/records/GCMD_NLDN.html) (NLDN) is a source of flash count data for North America.

This section describes how to prepare input parameter files for calculating lightning NO<sub>x</sub> emissions in-line in CCTM. If off-line lightning NO<sub>x</sub> emissions are preferred, it is the responsibility of the user to prepare a 4-D (row x col x layer x hour) I/O API netCDF file of lightning NO emissions with units of moles/s.

The program LTNG_2D_DATA prepares the input parameter file for estimating lightning NO emissions in-line with CCTM. The statistical package [R](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_%28software%29) is used as a preprocessor to LTNG_2D_DATA to prepare two input files to the program:

-   a land/ocean mask file
-   a file with ratios of intercloud to cloud-to-ground flashes

LTNG_2D_DATA reads those input files, plus

-   A [MET_CRO_2D](#MET_CRO_2D:_Two-dimensional_meteorological_cross-point_fields) file from MCIP
-   An I/O API netCDF file of monthly flash densities gridded to your modeling domain. 12-km continental U.S. monthly flash densities are available from the [CMAS Data Clearinghouse](https://www.cmascenter.org/download/data/nldn.cfm).
-   If those are not available, the program NLDN_2D (packaged with LTNG_2D_DATA) can produce them from raw hourly flash counts from the [NLDN](http://gcmd.nasa.gov/records/GCMD_NLDN.html).

LTNG_2D_DATA outputs [a parameters file](#LTNG_2D_DATA_output_files).

[Figure 7-8](#Figure7-8) shows the input and output files for LTNG_2D_DATA. The preprocessor Fortran program NLDN_2D inputs a text file of NLDN flash count data and a MET_CRO_2D file and outputs an I/O API netCDF file for input to LTNG_2D_DATA. The R batch script ocean_mask.R reads a MET_CRO_2D file to create an ocean mask CSV file on the modeling grid. The R batch script iccg.R reads a MET_CRO_2D file and a flash ratio text file and outputs a CSV-formatted flash ratio file on the modeling grid. The outputs of these processes are used by LTNG_2D_DATA, along with a MET_CRO_2D file, to produce a lightning NO<sub>x</sub> parameters file for input to CCTM. The MET_CRO_2D file must be consistent across all of the programs associated with LTNG_2D_DATA.

## MCIP

### Description

The Meteorology-Chemistry Interface Processor (MCIP) processes meteorological model output from either MM5 or WRF‑ARW model into I/O API-formatted files that are compatible with CMAQ and SMOKE. MCIP automatically determines whether an input file is generated by MM5 or WRF‑ARW by trying to open the file as a netCDF file. If the file can be read as netCDF, MCIP assumes the input is a WRF‑ARW dataset; otherwise, MM5 is assumed.

Many of the fields that are simulated by the meteorological model are not modified by MCIP for the emissions model and CCTM, and they are written to I/O API files. Fields that are required for the transformation to CMAQ’s generalized coordinate system are calculated within MCIP. The dry deposition velocities are no longer calculated by the current version of MCIP. CMAQv5 can now calculate all deposition velocities, MCIPv3.4 will be the last version of MCIP to calculate those velocities internally.

MCIP can extract both temporal and spatial subsets of the input meteorology files. The run script allows the user to specify the beginning and end dates/times of the MCIP simulation; these dates/times can fall anywhere within the range of the input meteorological time period, but must be consistent with the time granularity of the meteorological files. MCIP cannot perform temporal interpolations to artificially increase the temporal resolution of the meteorology fields. Two types of horizontal domain windowing are allowed with MCIP. The boundary trim option (“BTRIM”) uniformly trims grid cells off each of the four lateral boundaries of the input meteorology grid. The nonuniform trim option specifies an offset from the lower left corner of the input meteorology domain and the number of cells in the X and Y directions from the revised origin to extract from the input domain. More information about how to invoke these options is provided in the next section: [MCIP execution options](#MCIP execution options). MCIP also provides the capability to reconfigure the vertical layer structure in the input meteorology through interpolation from the input structure to an output structure defined through sigma coordinates in the run script. Commonly referred to as “layer collapsing,” this option should be exercised with caution as it can significantly impact the conservation of energy assumption inherent in the meteorology through its effects on the predicted wind fields.

### Files, configuration, and environment variables

[Figure 7‑9](#Figure7-9) shows the input and output files and configuration options for MCIP. All MCIP configurations are accomplished at execution (rather than at compile time) and via Fortran namelist variables, a distinction from the rest of the CMAQ programs. The user does not need to directly edit the MCIP namelist file. All configuration settings are contained in the MCIP run script, which automatically creates a new namelist file each time the script is executed.

The default location of the MCIP output files is the `$CMAQ_HOME/data/mcip/$GridName` directory. Since the default file names do not have any information about the model grid that they are simulating, the name of the grid is set in the output directory path. The default naming convention for all MCIP output files uses only the APPL environment variable in the file name. All of the file-naming variables for the MCIP outputs are set in the run script.

#### Compilation Configuration

All model configuration options for MCIP are set during execution. System compiler options must be set in the provided Linux Makefile to build the program for different operating system/compiler combinations. Example compiler paths, flags, and library locations are provided in the default Makefile.

-   `InSatFiles [default: None]`<br>
    List of input GOES satellite cloud data files.

-   `IfTer [default: F]`<br>

    Name and location of input MM5 TERRAIN or WRF Geogrid file

-   `LPV: [default: 0]`<br>
    Compute and output potential vorticity. This must be activated to support the [CCTM O3 potential vorticity scaling](../ReleaseNotes/Potential_Vorticity_Scaling.md).
    -   `0`: Do not compute and output potential vorticity
    -   `1`: Compute and output potential vorticity

    Output vertical velocities.
    -   `0`: Do not output vertical velocity
    -   `1`: Output vertical velocity


-   `LUVCOUT [default: 0]`<br>

    Beginning date and time (UTC) of data to output from MCIP. The start date and time must be contained within the input data from MM5 or WRF‑ARW.

-   `MCIP_END [format: YYYY-MM-DD-HH:MM:SS.SSSS]`<br>

-   `CTMLAYS [default: “-1.0” ]`<br>
    Sigma values of the vertical layers in the 3-D MCIP output. Comma-delimited values for each sigma value must be in descending order starting at 1 and ending with 0. There are a maximum of 100 layers allowed. To use the all of the layers from the input meteorology without collapsing (or explicitly specifying), set CTMLAYS = ‑1.0.

    Determines whether to output static (GRID) meteorology files

-   `BTRIM [default: 5]`<br>
    The number of boundary points to remove on each of the four horizontal sides of the MCIP domain. Setting BTRIM = 0 will specify the maximum extent of the input meteorology domain. To remove the MM5 or WRF‑ARW lateral boundaries, set BTRIM = 5 (recommended).

    This setting affects the output MCIP horizontal domain by reducing the input meteorology domain by 2*BTRIM + 2*NTHIK + 1, where NTHIK is the lateral boundary thickness (from the BDY files). The extra point reflects the conversion from the grid points (dot points) to grid cells (cross points).

    For windowing a subset domain of the input meteorology, set BTRIM = -1; this setting causes BTRIM to be replaced by the information provided by X0, Y0, NCOLS, and NROWS (see below).

-   `X0 [used only if BTRIM = -1]`<br>
    The *x*-coordinate of the lower-left corner of the full MCIP cross-point domain (including the MCIP lateral boundary) based on the input MM5 or WRF‑ARW domain. X0 refers to the east-west direction.

-   `Y0 [used only if BTRIM = -1]`<br>
    The *y*-coordinate of the lower-left corner of the full MCIP cross-point domain (including the MCIP lateral boundary) based on the input MM5 or WRF‑ARW domain. Y0 refers to the north-south direction.

-   `NCOLS [used only if BTRIM = -1]`<br>
    Number of columns in the output MCIP domain (excluding MCIP lateral boundaries)

-   `NROWS [used only if BTRIM = -1]`<br>
    Number of rows in the output MCIP domain (excluding MCIP lateral boundaries)

-   `LPRT_COL [default: 0]`<br>
    Column cell coordinate for diagnostic outputs on the MCIP modeling domain

-   `LPRT_ROW [default: 0]`<br>
    Row cell coordinate for diagnostic outputs on the MCIP modeling domain

-   `WRF_LC_REF_LAT [default: -999.0]`<br>
    WRF Lambert Conformal reference latitude. Use this setting to force the reference latitude in the output MCIP data. If not set, MCIP will use the average of the two true latitudes. This setting is useful for matching WRF grids to existing MM5 grids.

### Compiling and Running

#### Compile MCIP

[Chapter 5](CMAQ_OGD_ch05_sys_req.md) provides an overview of how to install and compile the CMAQ programs for the tutorial simulation. Follow the steps outlined in Chapter 5 (summarized below) to compile new versions of **MCIP**.

MCIP is compiled with a Makefile. The configuration options in the Makefile include only the compiler and compiler flags to use for building the executable. The Makefile is located in the directory with the MCIP source code (`$CMAQ_HOME/PREP/mcip/src`). To compile MCIP, source the config.cmaq file and invoke the Makefile at the command line:

`cd $CMAQ_HOME/PREP/mcip/src/`<br>
`source $CMAQ_HOME/config.cmaq`<br>
`./make |& tee make.mcip.log`

To port MCIP to different compilers, change the compiler names, locations, and flags in the config.cmaq script.

#### Run MCIP ####

Set the run script settings according to the execution configuration variables described above. Run MCIP to produce meteorology input data for the CCTM:

`cd $CMAQ_HOME/PREP/mcip`<br>
