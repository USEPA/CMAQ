CMAQ SUPPORT
============

Technical and operational user support for CMAQ are available free of charge from the Community Modeling and Analysis System Center ([<http://www.cmascenter.org>](http://www.cmascenter.org/)). The CMAS Center offers an e-mail help desk, and community listservs for posting questions about CMAQ. In addition to these community-based resources, the CMAS Center offers fee-based trainings, and provides a documentation library for CMAQ that includes operational and technical guidance manuals as well as references to primary literature involving CMAQ. The CMAS Center does not offer telephone or on-site support.

Additional CMAQ support can be obtained for a fee through support contracts with modeling contractors experienced in applying and developing CMAQ source code. Contact information for these contractors is available through the links page on the CMAS Center website.

The CMAS Center
---------------

Under contract to EPA, the Center for Environmental Modeling for Policy Development ([CEMPD](http://cf.unc.edu/cep/empd/)) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill ([UNC](http://www.unc.edu/)) Institute for the Environment maintains the CMAS Center for supporting community-based air quality modeling. CMAS is an approach to the development, application, and analysis of environmental models that leverages the complementary talents and resources of the modeling community in order to set new standards for quality in science and in the reliability of the application of the technology.

From research to application to outreach, the CMAS Center advances the community modeling paradigm through the establishment of a centralized resource to serve the members of the national and international environmental modeling community.

### CMAS functions

### CMAS community

A primary focus of CMAS is to instill a sense of community among the users of environmental models. From the individual to the organizational level, the beneficiaries of CMAS include (but are not limited to):

-   Government
-   Industry
-   Academia
-   Research
-   Consultants
-   Stakeholder groups

By promoting cooperation within and between the various groups in the environmental modeling community, CMAS forms the foundation to enable the community to participate in the examina­tion of issues and the subsequent development of strategies that meet societal challenges of environmental protection.

### Why is CMAS needed?

Historically, advancements in air quality model technology could not easily be shared among modelers because of technical incompatibilities. By standardizing with open-source, advanced modeling systems, CMAS enables collaborative development and linking of models for meteorology, emissions, air quality, and environmental and health effects. CMAS builds on the pioneering work by EPA and other research organizations by developing advanced tools to assist users in building models, developing datasets, analyzing results, and understanding model behavior. Because the CMAS-supported models use a “modular” approach with well-defined communications between modules, developers can upgrade existing processes or add new ones, thus ensuring the rapid evolution of the technology to meet the changing needs of the environmental modeling community.

CMAQ was EPA’s first tangible product to evolve out of the community modeling paradigm. With a framework for a community model in CMAQ, there is a need for centralized coordination of development and application efforts for mutual benefit to scientists, model developers, practitioners of modeling, and regulatory users of modeling results. CMAS and its accompany­ing center at the CEMPD facilitate the effort to draw the interest of the modeling community toward advancement through cooperation.

Getting Help with CMAQ
----------------------

The CMAS Center website ([<http://www.cmascenter.org>](http://www.cmascenter.org/)) includes a help desk with resources that are available to assist with CMAQ-related issues. The CMAS help desk services are free to the community. Many of the services in the help desk benefit from increased usage, such as the listserv discussion groups. E‑mail-based CMAQ technical consultation is available to registered CMAS participants only.

The following resources are available through the CMAS Center to address CMAQ-related questions. Community members should use these resources in the order that follows. There is currently a large, searchable database of resolved CMAQ support tickets; before submitting a new ticket to the help desk, be sure to search the database for keywords to see if the issue has been addressed previously. Section 11.3 provides a list of the web pages referenced in Section 11.2.

### Documentation

The first place to look for an answer to CMAQ-related questions is the on-line documentation for the software. The CMAS documentation page contains links to available documentation for current and previous releases of the various kinds of software that CMAS supports. Peruse these on-line manuals, as many of them contain FAQs and discussion specific to the various programs.

### Interactive resources

Search the CMAS FAQs and listservs for information about the question that you have. These services are organized by topic to facilitate searching. Look under the CMAS Model Clearinghouse area to find out about new releases, and read through the release notes of past releases for detailed information about the features of the models.

### Tutorials/training

General questions regarding model installation or application may be addressed in the online tutorials for the CMAS-supported software. More-specific tutorials will be added over time; users can suggest tutorial topics by contacting the CMAS Center.

The CMAS Center offers quarterly trainings on CMAQ at the Institute for the Environment offices in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA. CMAS training staff are also available to travel for on-site training anywhere in the world. The currently available training is an introductory course to CMAQ that covers configuration, compilation, and basic operation of the model. Visit the CMAS training web page to see an agenda, fees, and the schedules for upcoming training courses

### E-mail support

E-mail support is available to CMAS users who have a support account, and provides case-specific support for all CMAS-supported software, which includes CMAQ. CMAS e-mail support provides direct access to expert CMAQ users for questions about installation or operational issues. E-mail support also provides direct access to the CMAQ developers for technical questions about model formulation, model science, and code integration. Visit the e-mail support page for an explanation of how to use the system and to register.
