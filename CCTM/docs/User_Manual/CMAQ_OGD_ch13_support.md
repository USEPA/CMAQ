13. CMAQ Support Resources
============

Technical and operational user support for CMAQ are available free of charge from the Community Modeling and Analysis System Center ([<http://www.cmascenter.org>](http://www.cmascenter.org/)). The CMAS Center offers an e-mail help desk, and community listservs for posting questions about CMAQ. In addition to these community-based resources, the CMAS Center offers fee-based trainings, and provides a documentation library for CMAQ that includes operational and technical guidance manuals as well as references to primary literature involving CMAQ.

The CMAS Center
---------------
Under contract to EPA, the Center for Environmental Modeling for Policy Development ([CEMPD](http://ie.unc.edu/research/environmental-modeling/)) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill ([UNC](http://www.unc.edu/)) Institute for the Environment maintains the CMAS Center for supporting community-based air quality modeling. CMAS is an approach to the development, application, and analysis of environmental models that leverages the complementary talents and resources of the modeling community in order to set new standards for quality in science and in the reliability of the application of the technology.

From research to application to outreach, the CMAS Center advances the community modeling paradigm through the establishment of a centralized resource to serve the members of the national and international environmental modeling community.

Getting Help with CMAQ
----------------------

The CMAS Center website ([<http://www.cmascenter.org>](http://www.cmascenter.org/)) includes a help desk with resources that are available to assist with CMAQ-related issues. The CMAS help desk services are free to the community. Many of the services in the help desk benefit from increased usage, such as the listserv discussion groups. E‑mail-based CMAQ technical consultation is available to registered CMAS participants only.

The following resources are available through the CMAS Center to address CMAQ-related questions. Community members should use these resources in the order that follows. There is currently a large, searchable database of resolved CMAQ support tickets; before submitting a new ticket to the help desk, be sure to search the database for keywords to see if the issue has been addressed previously. Section 11.3 provides a list of the web pages referenced in Section 11.2.

### Documentation

The first place to look for an answer to CMAQ-related questions is the on-line documentation for the software. The CMAS documentation page contains links to available documentation for current and previous releases of the various kinds of software that CMAS supports. Peruse these on-line manuals, as many of them contain FAQs and discussion specific to the various programs.

### Interactive resources

Search the CMAS FAQs and listservs for information about the question that you have. These services are organized by topic to facilitate searching. Look under the CMAS Model Clearinghouse area to find out about new releases, and read through the release notes of past releases for detailed information about the features of the models.

### Tutorials/training

General questions regarding model installation or application may be addressed in the online tutorials for the CMAS-supported software. More-specific tutorials will be added over time; users can suggest tutorial topics by contacting the CMAS Center.

The CMAS Center offers quarterly trainings on CMAQ at the Institute for the Environment offices in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA. CMAS training staff are also available to travel for on-site training anywhere in the world. The currently available training is an introductory course to CMAQ that covers configuration, compilation, and basic operation of the model. Visit the CMAS training web page to see an agenda, fees, and the schedules for upcoming training courses

### E-mail support

E-mail support is available to CMAS users who have a support account, and provides case-specific support for all CMAS-supported software, which includes CMAQ. CMAS e-mail support provides direct access to expert CMAQ users for questions about installation or operational issues. E-mail support also provides direct access to the CMAQ developers for technical questions about model formulation, model science, and code integration. Visit the e-mail support page for an explanation of how to use the system and to register.
