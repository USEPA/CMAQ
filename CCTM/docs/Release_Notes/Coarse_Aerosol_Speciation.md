# Update Speciation for Coarse-Mode Aerosol

**Author/P.O.C.:**, [Ben Murphy](mailto:murphy.benjamin@epa.gov), Computational Exposure Division, U.S. EPA

## Brief Description
  The speciation of dust and sea salt have been updated to be consistent with ____ et al. Also, the constant values for coarse PM speciation, which were located throughout various routines (e.g. volinorg), have been gathered and employed in the AERO_DATA module for easy reference.

## Significance and Impact
  Small potential impact of ASOIL contribution to PM composition during large dust events. Little to no impact on long-term trends.
