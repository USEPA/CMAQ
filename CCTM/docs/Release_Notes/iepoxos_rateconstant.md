# Updated IEPOX organosulfate formation rate constant

**Author/P.O.C.:**, [Havala Pye](mailto:pye.havala@epa.gov), Computational Exposure Division, U.S. EPA

## Brief Description

IEPOX uptake to aqueous particles results in 2-methyltetrols, organosulfates, and other species. The organosulfate formation rate constant was updated to use the IEPOXOS:tetrol relative value from Piletic et al. (2013). Thus the aqueous organosulfate formation rate constant was updated to 8.83 x 10<sup>-3</sup> M<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>. We believe the old value was less accurate because it was based on nitrate and did not properly reflect the increased nucleophilic strength of sulfate vs water.


## Significance and Impact

Increases IEPOX organosulfates (species AIEOSJ in aero6i or a portion of AISO3J in aero6) and thus total SOA.
