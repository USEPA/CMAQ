# Inclusion of CB6r3 chemical mechanism

**Author/P.O.C.:**, [Deborah Luecken] (mailto:luecken.deborah@epa.gov), Computational Exposure Division, U.S. EPA

## Brief Description

Included with CMAQv5.2 is a new mechanism that has not been available in previous versions, the CB6r3 (Emery et al., 2015). CB6r3 is the fourth version of CB6 (Yarwood et al. 2010), which is based on CB05.

CB6 contains numerous changes from CB05, including updated reaction rates throughout, new operators to better represent alkoxy and peroxy radicals, additional explicit species to represent long-lived and abundant chemicals and those that form SOA, and additional representation of organic nitrates.  These changes are detailed in reports listed in the References section.

## Significance and Impact

Running CB6r3 in CMAQ takes approximately the same amount of time as CB05e51.

In simulations, CB6 generally produces lower NO2 and lower ozone, due to multiple factors including lowered production of alkylnitrates in the winter, lack of NOx recycling from alkyl nitrates, lower HO2 by considering alkoxy radical reactions where it is not automatically produced, and heterogeneous removal of nitrates. Since so many reactions and species have changed, it is difficult to separate out each modification, as some will act to increase ozone and some to decrease ozone and radicals.
