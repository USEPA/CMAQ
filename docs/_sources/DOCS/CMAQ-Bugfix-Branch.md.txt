## CMAQ Version X+ Overview
New CMAQ versions are released on the 'main' branch.  After a CMAQ release an additional bugfix or 'X+' branch is created.  The X+ branch is a continually evolving branch and is intended for users who wish to adopt the most recent bugfixes or minor updates that improve model stability, efficiency, etc. The X+ code has not been thoroughly evaluated or characterized so users must assume the risk of any unforeseen and undocumented impacts of code changes that have been incorporated since the most recent documented public release. The thoroughly vetted version of these bugfixes and updates are then included in the next public release of CMAQ.  For example, after CMAQv5.4 was released, a 5.4+ branch was added.  All of the tagged updates in the 5.4+ branch were then released with CMAQv5.5. 

Below is the record of tagged bugfix versions for each CMAQ release. 

### Record of changes to CMAQv5.5+  
To clone code with all of the CMAQv5.5 bug fixes issue the following command from within a working directory on your server:
