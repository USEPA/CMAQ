# CMAQ Benchmark Tutorials 

The following tutorials describe how to install and run the CMAQ test cases for the CMAQ base model, instrumented models, and coupled meteorology-chemistry models. 
These tutorials are designed to familiarize the user with the CMAQ suite of programs and to verify the installation of the software on your system via benchmarking.

Benchmarking CMAQ is recommended in the following circumstances: installation by a new user; installation on a new server; following a new CMAQ release;
following upgrades to your system kernel, Fortran/C compiler, netCDF library, or I/O API library.
