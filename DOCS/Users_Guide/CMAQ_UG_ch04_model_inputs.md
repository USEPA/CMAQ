# 4. Model Input Files

## 4.1 Introduction
This chapter provides basic information on the format and content of CMAQ input files.  It also provides information on using the pre-processing tools provided in the repository for preparing initial and boundary conditions and meteorology inputs.  Links are provided for  the emissions processing tools that are released through their own repository or website.  A list of CMAQ input files can be found in [Table 4-1](#Input_Table). Some CMAQ input files are in ASCII format while the majority of them are in the [Network Common Data Form (netCDF) format](http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf). CMAQ input and output files are self-describing netCDF-format files in which the file headers have all the dimensioning and descriptive information needed to define the resident data. Users should download the latest code for the NetCDF from the [NetCDF website](http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf). Compilation and configuration information for the NetCDF is available through the Unidata website.

All CMAQ input and output files are conformed to I/O API netCDF file format. Please refer to the [I/O API User's Manual](https://www.cmascenter.org/ioapi/documentation/all_versions/html) for details.

Full input datasets for 2016 over two domains are publically available to download from the CMAS Data Warehouse.  The input files are stored on Google Drive with metadata organized through Dataverse.

## 4.2 CMAQ Pre-processors 
[Figure 2-1](./images/Figure2-1.jpg) shows the relationship between CMAQ pre-processors and the main CMAQ program, the CMAQ Chemistry Transport Model (CCTM).  MCIP, ICON and BCON are included in the CMAQ repository and are used to create meteorological, initial conditions and boundary conditions inputs.  SMOKE, FEST-C and Spatial Allocator Tools are external software packages used for creating emissions inputs for CMAQ.  The following subsections provide more information on these tools and point the user to additional sources of documentation. 

### 4.2.1 Meteorology-Chemistry Interface Processor (MCIP)

MCIP processes meteorological fields output by the WRF model into files that are compatible with the CCTM and SMOKE (an emissions processor that computes emissions inputs for CMAQ). The output files generated by MCIP are used by ICON and BCON and various other programs in CMAQ, so MCIP must be the first program run after installing the CMAQ source codes and initializing CMAQ environment variables. Configuration options for MCIP include the time periods over which to extract data from the meteorological model output files, horizontal grid definitions for output, and control for optional 3D output variables. MCIP can either process the full horizontal domain from WRF or a user-defined subset of that domain (that is, a "window"). Most of the fields that are simulated by WRF are not modified by MCIP for the CCTM or emissions model and are simply "passed through" to the output. Where needed, MCIP transforms data from the WRF projection and coordinate system to be consistent with that being used for CMAQ simulations. 

Unlike many of the tools distributed with CMAQ, MCIP is compiled with a Makefile and then run with a run script. Instructions on how to compile and run MCIP are provided in the [README.md](../../PREP/mcip/README.md) file in the PREP/mcip folder.

### 4.2.2 Initial Conditions Processor (ICON)

ICON generates a gridded netCDF file of the chemical conditions for all grid cells in the modeling domain for the initial time of a simulation. It can generate these initial conditions from either an existing CCTM output file or one of four ASCII files of vertically resolved concentration profiles distributed with CMAQ. Running ICON requires that the user already generated MCIP files for their target modeling domain. For both input file options, ICON will interpolate the data to the horizontal and vertical structure of the target domain as defined in the MCIP files. The species in the ICON output file are identical to those in the input (either CCTM output or ASCII profile) file.

Using an existing CCTM output file to generate initial conditions is applicable when interpolating initial conditions from a coarse to a fine grid domain, as may occur when setting up nested simulations (simulations with finer-resolution grids that cover part of coarser-resolution grids). This is the preferred mode of specifying initial conditions since the spatial concentration patterns derived from the coarser-resolution simulation can be considered a first approximation of the concentration fields over the finer-resolution subdomain at the beginning of the simulation.

The four ASCII files of vertically resolved concentration profiles [distributed with CMAQ](../../PREP/bcon/src/profile) represent annual average concentrations at a grid cell over the Pacific derived from a simulation with the hemispheric version of CMAQv5.3 beta2 for the year 2016. As such, these concentration profiles are reflective of conditions in a remote marine environment. The simulation was performed with the cb6r3m_ae7_kmtbr chemical mechanism and profiles for racm_ae6_aq, saprc07tc_ae6_aq, and saprc07tic_ae7i_aq were derived using the species mapping approach described in Step 3 of the [CMAQ Tutorial on creating Initial and Boundary Conditions from Seasonal Average Hemispheric CMAQ Output](./Tutorials/CMAQ_UG_tutorial_HCMAQ_IC_BC.md). If one of these ASCII profile files is used to generate initial conditions, the resulting concentration fields will be uniform over the modeling domain and will not be a realistic representation of conditions over the modeling domain. As a result, simulations initialized with profile-derived rather than CCTM-derived concentration fields may require longer spin-up periods before conditions simulated within the domain no longer are influenced by these unrealistic initial concentration fields.  

The configuration options for ICON include choosing whether the initial conditions are generated from an existing CCTM output file or from an ASCII profile, and defining the horizontal and vertical grids and time for which initial conditions are to be generated. Information on configuring ICON for the different kinds of input data, environment variables, input and output files, compiling and running ICON are provided in the [README.md](../../PREP/icon/README.md) file in the PREP/icon folder.

### 4.2.3 Boundary Conditions Processor (BCON)

BCON generates a netCDF file of the chemical conditions along the lateral boundaries of the modeling domain. BCON will generate an output file with chemical concentrations for all grid cells along the modeling domain's horizontal boundaries. It can generate these boundary conditions from either an existing CCTM output file or one of four ASCII files of vertically resolved concentration profiles distributed with CMAQ. Running BCON requires that the user already generated MCIP files for their target modeling domain. For both input file options, BCON will interpolate the data to the horizontal and vertical structure of the target domain as defined in the MCIP files. The species in the BCON output file are identical to those in the input (either CCTM output or ASCII profile) file. Depending on user specified options and/or input datasets, the boundary conditions generated by BCON can be time varying, time independent, and either spatially uniform or variable across the model boundaries.

Using an existing CCTM output file to generate boundary conditions is applicable when setting up windowed simulations (simulations with the same resolution that cover only a part of the outer domain) or nested simulations (simulations with finer-resolution grids that cover part of coarser-resolution grids). This is the preferred mode of specifying boundary conditions since the spatial concentration patterns derived from the coarser-resolution simulation will be spatially varying along the boundaries of the finer-resolution domain. Boundary conditions generated from CCTM output files will be either time varying or time independent.

The four ASCII files of vertically resolved concentration profiles [distributed with CMAQ](../../PREP/bcon/src/profile) represent annual average concentrations at a grid cell over the Pacific derived from a simulation with the hemispheric version of CMAQv5.3 beta2 for the year 2016. As such, these concentration profiles are reflective of conditions in a remote marine environment. The simulation was performed with the cb6r3m_ae7_kmtbr chemical mechanism and profiles for racm_ae6_aq, saprc07tc_ae6_aq, and saprc07tic_ae7i_aq were derived using the species mapping approach described in Step 3 of the [CMAQ Tutorial on creating Initial and Boundary Conditions from Seasonal Average Hemispheric CMAQ Output](./Tutorials/CMAQ_UG_tutorial_HCMAQ_IC_BC.md). If one of these ASCII profile files is used to generate boundary conditions, the resulting concentration fields will be uniform along the boundaries of the modeling domain and will not vary in time. Therefore, they are not a realistic representation of conditions along the domain boundaries and should only be used in cases where boundary conditions are not expected to affect the interpretation of model results. 

CMAQ can use boundary conditions derived from global chemistry models (GCMs). While BCON does not directly support processing of datasets from GCMs (other than the hemispheric version of CMAQ) in their native formats, users could develop their own custom codes to transform their GCM datasets into I/O API format, which would then allow these datasets to be input into BCON in the same way as an existing CCTM output file. 

The configuration options for BCON include choosing whether the boundary conditions are generated from an existing CCTM output file or from an ASCII profile, and defining the horizontal and vertical grids and time period for which boundary conditions are to be generated. Information on configuring BCON for the different kinds of input data, environment variables, input and output files, compiling and running BCON are provided in the [README.md](../../PREP/bcon/README.md) file in the PREP/bcon folder.

### 4.2.4 External Software Programs for Preparing CMAQ Inputs
The SMOKE and FEST-C modeling systems and the Spatial Allocator tools are used to create CMAQ emissions and land surface inputs. These systems are maintained by EPA and CMAS developers and are hosted and supported by the CMAS Center.  Links to documentation and software download for each system are provided below. 

**Emissions Processor (SMOKE)** 
[Sparse Matrix Operator Kerner Emissions (SMOKE) Modeling System](https://www.cmascenter.org/smoke/) is designed to create gridded, speciated, hourly emissions for input into CMAQ and other air quality models. SMOKE supports area, biogenic, mobile (both onroad and nonroad), and point source emissions processing for criteria, particulate, and toxic pollutants. For biogenic emissions modeling, SMOKE uses the Biogenic Emission Inventory System. 

**Fertilizer Emissions Processor (FEST-C)**
The [Fertilizer Emission Scenario Tool for CMAQ (FEST-C)](https://www.cmascenter.org/fest-c/) system is used to generate agricultural-land nitrogen and soil information for CMAQ bi-directional NH<sub>3</sub> modeling. FEST-C contains three main components: Java interface, Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model, and SA Raster Tools. The interface guides users through generating required land use and crop data and EPIC input files and simulating EPIC, and extracting EPIC output for CMAQ. 

FEST-C is used to create the [E2C_LU](#e2c_lu), [E2C_SOIL](#e2c_soil), and [E2C_CHEM](#e2c_chem) files discussed later in this chapter. 

**Processing Spatial Data with the Spatial Allocator (SA)**
The [Spatial Allocator](https://www.cmascenter.org/sa-tools/) is a set of tools that helps users manipulate and generate data files related to emissions and air quality modeling. The tools perform functions similar to Geographic Information Systems (GIS), but are provided to the modeling community free of charge. In addition, the tools are designed to support some of the unique aspects of the file formats used for CMAQ, SMOKE and WRF modeling.

SA is used to generate the surf zone and open ocean file that is a required input for utilizing marine emissions and chemistry in CMAQ. Some chemical mechanisms require the presence of additional variables in the ocean file which can be added by using a Python based tool. This file is discussed later in this chapter under the [OCEAN_1: Sea spray mask](#ocean_1) section.

**Python tool for adding DMS and CHLO in the OCEAN file** 
An ocean mask file (OCEAN) containing OPEN (open ocean) and SURF (surf zone) is needed for sea spray emissions module in CMAQ. Some chemical mechanisms (e.g., CB6r5m_ae7_aq) in CMAQ include halogen and DMS chemistry which requires additional parameters in the OCEAN file: DMS (DMS concentrations in seawater) and CHLO (monthly climatological chl-a concentration from MODIS). A Python based tool has been developed for adding DMS and CHLO to the OCEAN file (PYTOOLS/dmschlo/CMAQ_DMS_ChlorA_Plot.ipynb). Not all chemical mechanisms need DMS and CHLO and some (CB6r5_ae7_aq) only need DMS.

Additional information on processing data for CMAQ inputs is provided in [Appendix C](Appendix/CMAQ_UG_appendixC_spatial_data.md).

## 4.3 CMAQ Input Files

[Jump to Table of Input Files](#Input_Table)<br>
[Jump to CCTM Output Files in Chapter 7](CMAQ_UG_ch07_model_outputs.md)

CMAQ requires a basic set of input files: initial condition file, which is created by ICON process or previous day output; boundary condition file, which is created by BCON process; emission files; and meteorological data created by MCIP using WRF and terrain data. Additional input files may be required based on specific run time options. CMAQ output files include a basic set of files with aerosol and gas-phase species concentrations, wet and dry deposition estimates, and visibility metrics, and an auxiliary set of output files for diagnosing model performance and in-line-calculated emissions.  Model outputs are discussed in [Chapter 7](CMAQ_UG_ch07_model_outputs.md).

Rather than forcing the user to deal with hard-coded file names or hard-coded unit numbers, the I/O API netCDF file format utilizes the concept of logical file names. The modelers can define the logical names as properties of a program, and then at run-time the logical names can be linked to the actual file name using environment variables. For programming purposes, the only limitations are that logical file names cannot contain blank spaces and must be at most 16 characters long. When a modeler runs a program that uses the I/O API format, environment variables must be used to set the values for the program’s logical file names. A complete list of CMAQ input is provided in [Table 4-1](#Input_Table).

This section describes each of the input files required by the various CMAQ programs. The section begins with a description of the grid definition file, GRIDDESC, which is used by several CMAQ programs, and then goes through a program-by-program listing of the CMAQ input file requirements. [Table 4-1](#Input_Table) lists the source, file type (e.g. ASCII, [GRDDED3](https://www.cmascenter.org/ioapi/documentation/all_versions/html/DATATYPES.html), [BNDARY3](https://www.cmascenter.org/ioapi/documentation/all_versions/html/DATATYPES.html), etc.), and temporal and spatial dimensions of each CMAQ input file.   Typical time step is 1 hour; however a user can specify a finer one, e.g. 20 minutes. In addition, typical thickness of a boundary file is 1, i.e. NTHIK = 1 but it can be any positive integer.

**Table 4-1. CMAQ input files.**  Note that when "Time-Dependence" is listed as "Hourly", it is shorthand for a time-varying file.  It is recommended that CMAQ use a time increment that is no longer than one hour.  However, CMAQ can be run with a Time Dependence that is shorter than hourly.

### 4.3.1 Windowing Capability
Under the assumption that all inputs utilize the same projection and grid resolution, CMAQ allows users to provide a gridded input files which covers a different geographic extent but are a proper super set of the simulation domain. Proper super set means that the simulated domain must be at least one grid cell smaller at all sides than the gridded input (see Figure 4-3-1 below). This capability excludes the chemical boundary condition file (BCFILE) which must be created for the simulated domain using the BCON program. This capability applies to meteorological data files, however, METBDY3D won't be used, and the meteorological boundary information will be extracted from METCRO3D directly. For point source files, CMAQ already can discern if a particular point source is within the simulation domain or not as long as the files also use the same projection.

**GRIDDESC: Horizontal domain definition**

<!-- BEGIN COMMENT -->

[Return to Table 4-1](#griddesc_t)

<!-- END COMMENT -->

Used by: ICON, BCON, CCTM

The CMAQ grid description file (**GRIDDESC**) is an ASCII file that contains two sections: a horizontal coordinate section, and domain description section. The GRIDDESC file is generated automatically by MCIP; alternatively, GRIDDESC can be created using a text editor.

The horizontal coordinate section consists of text records that provide the coordinate-system name, the map projection, and descriptive parameters that define the projection.  This section is used to provide projection information that is used by a family of nested domains, where the coordinate-system name is shared by each of the domains. 

The grid description section consists of text records that indicate the grid name, related coordinate-system name (i.e., which GRIDDESC horizontal coordinate name that is defined in the previous section that is applied to this grid), and descriptive parameters for the coordinates of the lower-left corner of the grid, grid cell size, number of columns, and rows. There are at most 32 coordinate systems and 256 grids that can be listed in one of these files. These files are small enough to be archived easily with a study and have a sufficiently simple format that can easily be constructed "by hand."  The elements of the GRIDDESC files are typically included with the metadata for the output files in the CMAQ system.

An example of a GRIDDESC file is shown below:

```
' '
'LAM_40N100W'                          
2 30.0 60.0 -100.0 -100.0 40.0
' '                                           
'M_32_99TUT02'
'LAM_40N100W' 544000.0 -992000.0 32000.0 32000.0 38 38 1
' '
```

The horizontal coordinate section (first section) in this example GRIDDESC file defines a horizontal coordinate named “LAM_40N100W”. The coordinate definition is for a Lambert conformal grid, keyed by the first column of the coordinate description line, which corresponds to the numeric code for the various I/O API-supported grid types (2 = Lambert). The next three parameters (P_ALP, P_BET, and P_GAM) have different definitions for different map projections. For Lambert conformal, P_ALP and P_BET are the true latitudes of the projection cone (30°N and 60°N in the example), and P_GAM (100°W in the example) is the central meridian of the projection. The last two parameters, XCENT and YCENT, are the reference longitude and latitude for the domain, which are 100°W and 40°N in the example.

The second section in the example describes a domain named “M_32_99TUT02”. In this example, the coordinate named “LAM_40N100W” is referenced in the domain definition. The next two parameters in the domain definition (XORIG and YORIG) are the east-west and north-south offsets from XCENT and YCENT in meters. The next two parameters (XCELL and YCELL) are the horizontal grid spacing in meters for the X and Y directions (i.e., &#916;x and &#916;y). The next two parameters (NCOLS and NROWS) are the numbers of grid cells in the X and Y directions. The grid definition concludes with the number of boundary cells, NTHIK, which is typically set to 1. Note that the number of boundary cells for CMAQ differs from that used by WRF.

Additional information about the parameters in the GRIDDESC file can be found in the [I/O API Documentation](https://www.cmascenter.org/ioapi/documentation/all_versions/html/GRIDS.html).

**{gc|ae|nr|tr}_matrix.nml: Species namelist files**
<!-- BEGIN COMMENT -->
[Return to Table 4-1](#matrix_nml_t)
<!-- END COMMENT -->

Used by: CCTM, CHEMMECH

Namelist look-up tables for different classes of simulated pollutants are used to define the parameters of different model species during the execution of the CMAQ programs. Gas-phase (gc), aerosol (ae), non-reactive (nr), and tracer (tr) species namelist files contain parameters for the model species that are included in these different classifications. The species namelist files are used to control how the different CMAQ programs and processes handle the model species. The namelist files define the following processes for each model species:


-   Initial conditions  which initial condition species is the pollutant mapped to; if not specified, this will default to the species name.
-   IC Factor  if the pollutant is mapped to an initial condition species, uniformly apply a scaling factor to the concentrations.
-   Boundary conditions  which boundary condition species is the pollutant mapped to; if not specified, this will default to the species name.
-   BC Factor  if the pollutant is mapped to a boundary condition species, uniformly apply a scaling factor to the concentrations.

The namelist files contain header information that describe which class of species are contained in the file, the number of parameters contained in the file, headers describing the parameter fields, and then a series of rows with configuration parameters for every model species. [Table 4-2](#Table4-2) contains the namelist file format for the gas-phase (GC) species namelist file. The namelist files for the other species classifications (AE, NR, TR) are similar to the format shown in [Table 4-2](#Table4-2).

**CMAQ_Control_Misc.nml: Miscellaneous Control Variables**
<!-- BEGIN COMMENT -->
[Return to Table 4-1](#miscctrl_t)
<!-- END COMMENT -->

Used by: ELMO, Budget Tool, DESID
 
This control file provides an interface to activate/deactivate and set parameters for the operation of the Explicit and Lumped CMAQ Model Output module (ELMO; [Appendix F](Appendix/CMAQ_UG_appendixF_elmo_output.md)), the Budget Tool (Chapter 9), and an aspect of the DESID emissions interface. The variables for the ELMO and Budget Tool modules should be chosen in this file in the &elmo_activate, &elmo_inst, &elmo_avrg, and &Budget_Options sections. 

The final sections (&Chemical_FamVars and &ChemicalFamilies) allow users to define chemical families for output that can be referred to by ELMO, The Budget Tool or DESID. For example, 'NOX' may be defined as a chemical family containing 'NO' and 'NO2'. 
The &Chemical_FamVars section should be used to define the total number of chemical families that will be specified (N_Chem_Fams) and the maximum number of chemical species among all defined chemical families (Max_Chem_Fam_Members). For example, if a user defined three chemical families including 'NOX','AROMATICS', and 'BSOA', then a chemical family entry could be written as follows:

```
&Chem_FamVars  
  N_Chem_Fams = 3  
  Max_Chem_Fam_Members = 10  
 /  
 &ChemicalFamilies  
  ChemFamilyName(1) = 'NOX'
  ChemFamilyMembers(1,:) = 'NO','NO2'  
  
  ChemFamilyName(2) = 'AROMATICS'
  ChemFamilyMembers(2,:) = 'TOL','XYL','BENZ','NAPH'  
  
  ChemFamilyName(3) = 'DUST'
  ChemFamilyMembers(3,:) = 'ACORS','ASOIL','AECI','AECJ','AFEJ','AALJ','ATIJ','ASIJ','ACAJ','AMGJ','AKJ','AMNJ'

Used by: CCTM

The initial concentrations of each species being modeled must be input to CMAQ. The initial conditions input file type is GRDDED3 and does not vary with time. The actual file data are organized in this manner: by column, by row, by layer, by variable. Initial conditions files have the same structure as concentration files, so the predicted concentrations from the last hour of day 1 can be used to initialize the following day’s simulation. This gives CMAQ users the flexibility to segment simulations in any way they choose.

Used by: CCTM

CMAQ boundary condition data are of the BNDARY3 file type. Produced by the boundary condition processor, BCON, CCTM reads these data and correlates them with the interior data using a pointer system. This pointer system designates the beginning location of the data in memory that start a new side of the domain (i.e., south, east, north, or west). Consult I/O API User Guide for a pictorial description.

Each species being modeled should be in the BNDY_CONC_1 file. If some modeled species are not contained in this file, the boundary condition for these species will default to the value 1 × 10e<sup>-30</sup>. The perimeter of the CMAQ domain is NTHIK cell wide (typically NTHIK = 1), where the number of boundary cells = NTHIK\*(2\*NCOLS + 2\*NROWS +4\*NTHIK).

**DESID_Ctrl_nml: DESID Control Namelist**

<!-- BEGIN COMMENT -->

[Return to Table 4-1](#desidctrl_t)

<!-- END COMMENT -->

In addition to the options available in the RunScript, CMAQ now reads dedicated namelists in order to apply comprehensive rules for reading and scaling emissions. The first of these namelists, called the DESID Control Namelist is named "CMAQ_Control_DESID.nml" by default. This namelist is stored in the repo in the emissions source code folder and is copied into the user's build directory when bldit_cctm.csh is executed. If the user modifies the name or location of this namelist, then the following command in the RunScript should be updated as well:
```
setenv DESID_CTRL_NML ${BLD}/CMAQ_DESID_Ctrl.nml
```

The Detailed Emissions Scaling, Isolation and Diagnostics (DESID) module included with CMAQv5.3 and beyond provides comprehensive customization and transparency of emissions manipulation to the user. The customization of emissions is accomplished via two namelist files, the first of which is the DESID Control Namelist. This namelist contains several sections of distinct options that modify the behavior of the emissions module. These include ***Desid_Options***, ***Area Normalization***, ***Size Distributions***, ***Region Definitions***, ***Stream Family Definitions***, and ***Diagnostic Output Options***.

* [Jump to DESID Tutorial](Tutorials/CMAQ_UG_tutorial_emissions.md) for step by step instructions on performing some basic manipulation of emission streams.
* [Jump to Emissions overview](CMAQ_UG_ch06_model_configuration_options.md) in Chapter 6 of this User's Guide.

<!-- BEGIN COMMENT -->

[Return to Table 4-1](#desidchemctrl_t)

<!-- END COMMENT -->

The second namelist used for specifying DESID operations is the DESID Chemical Mapping Control namelist, named "CMAQ_Control_DESID_[mech]". By default, every mechanism has its own version of this namelist because each is preloaded with likely rules linking emissions of important CMAQ primary species to their typical surrogate names as output by SMOKE. By default, this namelist is stored in each chemical mechanism folder (e.g. MECHS/cb6r3_ae7_aq) and is copied into the user's build directory when bldit_cctm.csh is executed. If the user modifies the name or location of this namelist, then the following command in the RunScript should be updated as well:
```

**GR_EMIS_XXX: Emissions**

<!-- BEGIN COMMENT -->

[Return to Table 4-1](#emis_xxx_t)

<!-- END COMMENT -->

Used by: CCTM

CMAQ may accept emissions inputs from a variety of emissions models and preprocessors, as long as the input files created are compatible with I/O API format. The most commonly used software for preparing emissions inputs is the Sparse Matrix Operator Kernel Emissions (SMOKE) modeling system, which is a collection of programs that separately process and merge emissions data for each emissions stream for input to air quality models.

The emissions file provides primary pollutant emission rates by model grid cell and time. The file type is GRDDED3, and the units are in moles per second (moles s<sup>-1</sup>) for gas-phase species and grams per second (g s<sup>-1</sup>) for aerosol species. The file data are looped as follows: by column, by row, by layer, by variable, and by input time step. Elevated source emission rates may be provided to CCTM as vertically resolved emissions if the GR_EMIS_XXX file is 3D. The gridded emissions files should be assigned three-digit numeric suffixes to identify them. This suffix is used to link the emission filename to user-defined stream labels and other options (e.g. GR_EMIS_LAB_XXX, GR_EM_DTOVRD_XXX). Linking and modifying emissions streams is discussed further in [Chapter 6](CMAQ_UG_ch06_model_configuration_options.md).

Starting in CMAQv5.3, users can run with as many gridded emission files as desired, including zero files. Make sure the N_EMIS_GR runtime variable is set to reflect the number of gridded emission files.

**OCEAN_1: Sea spray mask**

<!-- BEGIN COMMENT -->

[Return to Table 4-1](#ocean_1_t)

<!-- END COMMENT -->

Used by: CCTM

The CMAQ sea spray emissions module requires the input of an ocean mask file (OCEAN). OCEAN is a time-independent I/O API file that identifies the fractional [0-1] coverage in each model grid cell allocated to open ocean (OPEN) or surf zone (SURF). The CCTM uses this coverage information to calculate sea spray emission fluxes from the model grid cells online during a CCTM run. 

Additionally, CMAQ's gas-phase chemical mechanisms except cb6r5m_ae7_aq contain an effective first order halogen mediated ozone loss over the ocean (where OPEN + SURF > 0.0). The OCEAN file is also required for this process. The cb6r5m_ae7_aq mechanism contains bromine, iodine and DMS chemistry and requires the OCEAN file with two additional variables: DMS (monthly mean climatological DMS concentrations in seawater) and CHLO (monthly mean climatological chlorophyll concentration). The cb6r5_ae7_aq mechanism contains DMS chemistry and requires the OCEAN file with DMS (monthly mean climatological DMS concentration in seawater).


See the [CMAQ Ocean File Tutorial](Tutorials/CMAQ_UG_tutorial_oceanfile.md) for step by step instructions on creating this file and for adding DMS and CHLO to the ocean files.

Used by: CCTM  online BEIS biogenics emissions version only

The speciation profile file, GSPRO, contains the factors that are used to separate aggregated inventory pollutant emissions totals into emissions of model species in the form required by CMAQ. If only biogenic emissions are being calculated online in CMAQ, the GSPRO file used by CCTM needs to contain split factors only for the biogenic VOC emissions that are input in the B3GRD file. If other emissions sources are being calculated by CCTM, VOC split factors for these other sources must be included in the GSPRO file. The GSPRO file format is listed in the SMOKE user’s manual, see: [GSPRO documentation](https://www.cmascenter.org/smoke/documentation/4.0/html/ch08s05s02.html).

STAGE is a tiled surface exchange option that estimates deposition and emissions by land use and area weights them to the grid cell. There is the option to develop custom land use mappings to reduce the redundancy in model calculations and allow the user to customize land use specific deposition for their specific ecosystem exposure or deposition needs. The MET_TO_STAGE_LU section of CMAQ_Control_STAGE namelist allows for the mapping of the meteorological model’s land use data to the user defined STAGE land use categories. These tables have been populated for WRF implimentations of MODIS, NLCD and USGS land use types and require no further modification for the default land use mapping.
