# CMAQv5.3 User's Guide


The CMAQ User's Guide is designed to support the installation, configuration, and execution of the [Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ)](http://www.epa.gov/cmaq) model on Linux systems. CMAQ users should be comfortable with Linux scripting conventions and have some familiarity with the Fortran programming language. Users should also have some familiarity with atmospheric structure, and the physical and chemical processes that occur in the atmosphere.

# Table of Contents

* Running the CMAQ Test Case
* Prescribing Emissions Using the DESID Module 
* Creating an OCEAN File
* Adding an Inert Tracer Species
* Creating IC/BCs from Seasonal Average Hemispheric CMAQ Output
