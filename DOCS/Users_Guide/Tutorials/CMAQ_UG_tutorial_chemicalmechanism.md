### Modifying a Chemical Mechanism in CMAQ ###


Goal: Modify the gas- and aerosol-phase chemical mechanisms in CMAQ, create new solver source code files, and propagate all the changes in Github. This tutorial includes examples with expected impacts on SOA precursors and products, and is not expected to have substantial impacts on ozone or other radical chemistry. Caution: If significant modifications are made to the gas-phase mechanism that alter the radical balance, the ebi implementation of the modified mechanism should be checked against an alternative solver such as ros3 or smvgear. This example does not include extensive modifications of that nature.

## 1. Modifying the chemical mechanism inputs ##
### 1.1 See the [git instructions](#github) below if you would like to propagate the chemical mechanism changes in your Github repository. If you are assigning a new name to your mechanism, create a new folder under /$CMAQ_REPO/CCTM/src/MECHS and copy and update the names of all chemical namelist files, the mech_*.def file, the CMAQ_Control_DESID_*.nml namelist, and the SpecDef_*.txt file, if desired.  


<a id=mech_def></a>
### 1.2 Edit mech_*.def.
The mech_*.def file lists all of CMAQ chemical reactions and is located at /$CMAQ_REPO/CCTM/src/MECHS/${mechanism}/mech_/${mechanism}.def. The [chemmech documentation](../../../UTIL/chemmech/README.md) describes formats for reaction rate constants dependent on temperature, atmospheric number density, water vapor, sunlight, model species and constants such as oxygen and methane mixing ratios. The documentation also gives a more detailed explanation of the mech.def (mechanism definitions) sections and formatting rules.
- All reactions must begin with a name in < > brackets.
- All reactions must end with # followed by a reaction rate constant with units of cm<sup>3</sup>/(molecules s)
- In this tutorial, all reactions regenerate the oxidant.

In this example, we add an Odum 2-product model to the **cb6r5_ae7_aq** chemical mechanism by reacting a gas-phase precursor (TPROD) with OH to form two semivolatile gas-phase species (SVTPROD1, SVTPROD2) with alpha values of 0.15 and 0.8 by mole and a rate constant of 4.5 x 10^<sup>-11</sup> cm<sup>3</sup>/(molecules s):
```
<TWOPROD> TPROD + OH = OH + 0.15 * SVTPROD1 + 0.80 * SVTPROD2 #4.50E-11;
```
To form a nonvolatile, accumulation mode SOA species (ANONVJ) from a gas-phase IVOC species (NONVG) with an SOA yield of 5% by mole and a rate constant of 2 x 10<sup>-11</sup> cm<sup>3</sup>/(molecules s):
```
<NONV> NONVG + OH = OH + 0.05 * ANONVJ #2.00E-11;
```


<a id=GCnml></a>
### 1.3 Edit GC namelist.
The GC namelist defines gas-phase species and their physical and chemical properties. It is located at /$CMAQ_REPO/CCTM/src/MECHS/${mechanism}/GC_${mechanism}.nml.
You must add a new row for every gas-phase species that was added to [mech.def](#mech_def). See [Chapter 4](../CMAQ_UG_ch04_model_inputs.md) for more information.
TPROD, SVTPROD1, SVTPROD2, and NONVG from the examples above must be added to the GC namelist because they are gas-phase species. Column descriptions can be found in [Chapter 4](../CMAQ_UG_ch04_model_inputs.md). In this example, TPROD does not participate in dry deposition - similar to many other VOCs in CMAQ - so 'DRYDEP SURR' and 'DDEP' are empty and FAC is -1. NONVG (an IVOC as defined above), SVTPROD1, and SVTPROD2 do participate in dry deposition because of their low volatilities. This tutorial does not explain the process of creating new dry deposition surrogates, but it is possible to do so and replace 'VD_GEN_ALD'. The WET-SCAV SURR are described in the [hlconst.F](#hlconst) section below. 'GC2AE SURR' lists the species that partition between gas and aerosol phases in [SOA_DEFN.F](#SOA_DEFN).
```

```



<a id=AEnml></a>
### 1.4 Edit AE namelist.
The AE namelist defines all aerosol-phase species and their physical and chemical properties and is located at /$CMAQ_REPO/CCTM/src/MECHS/${mechanism}/AE_${mechanism}.nml
You must add a new row for every aerosol-phase species added to [AERO_DATA.F](#AERO_DATA). See [Chapter 4](../CMAQ_UG_ch04_model_inputs.md) for more information.
ANONV and the aerosol products from the Odum 2-product model must be added to the AE namelist. The semivolatile Odum 2-product species (SVTPROD1 and SVTPROD2) partition between the gas and accumulation mode aerosol phase with ATPROD1 and ATPROD2. Column descriptions can be found in [Chapter 4](../CMAQ_UG_ch04_model_inputs.md). The aerosol species names should omit any suffix indicating the particle mode of the species (e.g. i, j, or k). Instead, users should indicate which modes the species is in using the 'Aitken', 'Accum', and 'Coarse' columns.  
```
!SPECIES   ,MOLWT   ,Aitken  ,Accum  ,Coarse  ,IC     ,IC_FAC ,BC     ,BC_FAC ,DRYDEP SURR ,FAC ,WET-SCAV SURR  ,FAC ,AE2AQ SURR     ,TRNS    ,DDEP    ,WDEP    ,CONC

```

<a id=NRnml></a>
### 1.5 Edit NR namelist.
The NR namelist defines gas-phase species that are not in the mech.def file, and their physical and chemical properties. Species in this file are typically the semivolatile gases that partition between the gas- and aerosol-phases. It is located at /$CMAQ_REPO/CCTM/src/MECHS/${mechanism}/NR_${mechanism}.nml.
You must add a new row for every nonreactive species, if any, added to the chemical mechanism that is not explicitly modeled in [mech.def](#mech_def). See [Chapter 4](../CMAQ_UG_ch04_model_inputs.md) for descriptions of the information in each column.
The examples used in this tutorial do not include species that need to be added to the NR namelist. Follow the sesquiterpene SOA formation mechanism as an example of NR species (e.g. follow SESQRXN, SVSQT, and ASQTJ in /$CMAQ_REPO/CCTM/src/MECHS/${mechanism}/ and /$CMAQ_REPO/CCTM/src/aero/aero6/). If an aerosol species is added via the NR namelist, its name must (for now) include the suffix denoting the size of the mode the species is active in (i.e. i, j, or k).



<a id=DESID_Ctrl></a>
### 1.6 Edit DESID Chemical Mapping Control file.
The DESID Chemical Mapping Control file describes how to input emissions and is located at /$CMAQ_REPO/CCTM/src/MECHS/${mechanism}/CMAQ_Control_DESID_${mechanism}.nml. Any new species included in the mech_*.def or GC, AE, and NR namelists that is directly emitted should be included in this file. Examples of adding new species are given in the [DESID tutorial](CMAQ_UG_tutorial_emissions.md).



<a id=SpecDef></a>
### 1.7 Edit SpecDef file.
The SpecDef file is used to aggregate CMAQ output species (e.g. into PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and convert units. It is used to run the post-processing tool [combine](../../../POST/combine/README.md) and is located at /$CMAQ_REPO/CCTM/src/MECHS/${mechanism}/SpecDef_{mechanism}.txt.
To convert the units of a gas-phase species to ppb, add the following line:
```
NEWGAS          ,ppbV      ,1000.*NEWGAS[1]
```
To add a new species to OA mass, add it to the appropriate POA or SOA variables. For example, to add a new SOA accumulation-mode aerosol species ANEWJ, include '+ANEWJ[1]' in ASOMJ. This change will be reflected in subsequent variable definitions that use ASOMJ.

If your simulation domain is an urban area, move AGLYJ from AORGB (biogenic VOC-derived aerosol) to AORGA (anthropogenic VOC-derived SOA).

In some cases you may want to remove pcSOA from your SOA. In this case, you must create new variables with APCSOJ subtracted. For example, to calculate PM<sub>1</sub> SOA without pcSOA, update the following variables:
```
AOMJ_MP         ,ug m-3    ,APOMJ[0]  + ASOMJ[0] - APCSOJ[1]
ATOTJ_MP        ,ug m-3    ,ASO4J[1]+ANO3J[1]+ANH4J[1]+ANAJ[1]+ACLJ[1] \
                           +AECJ[1]+AOMJ_MP[0]+AOTHRJ[1]+AFEJ[1]+ASIJ[1]  \
                           +ATIJ[1]+ACAJ[1]+AMGJ[1]+AMNJ[1]+AALJ[1]+AKJ[1]
PM1_TOT_MP      ,ug m-3    ,ATOTI[0]*PM1AT[3]+ATOTJ_MP[0]*PM1AC[3]+ATOTK[0]*PM1CO[3]
```
To update the OC variables or the deposition of OC variables in the SpecDef_Dep_{mechanism}.txt file, you must know the OM:OC ratios of the new organic aerosol species.

In CMAQv5.5, the new Explicit and Lumped CMAQ Model Output (ELMO) module performs all of the aerosol processing online in CMAQ, so that variables like organic aerosol mass and PM<sub>2.5</sub> mass are output directly from the model to files with prefixes CCTM_ELMO_ and CCTM_AELMO_, for instantaneous and averaged values respectively. FOr more information, see the [ELMO documentation](../Appendix/CMAQ_UG_appendixG_elmo_output.md).



<a id=SOA_DEFN></a>
### 1.8 Edit SOA_DEFN.F
SOA_DEFN.F describes SOA precursors, SOA species and their properties dealing with gas to particle partitioning. It is located at /$CMAQ_REPO/CCTM/src/aero/aero6/SOA_DEFN.F. Note that the aero7 and cracmm directories are linked to the aero6 directory.

You must add a row for every new SOA species and increase **n_oa_list** by the number of species added to the list (in this tutorial you would add 3).

To add semivolatile species that partition between the gas and aerosol phases (with a gas-phase species defined in the [GC namelist](#GCnml)), include their effective saturation concentrations (C*) and enthalpies of vaporization. In this example, ATPROD1 (nominally biogenic) has the corresponding gas-phase species SVTPROD1 and has C* = 0.95 ug/m<sup>3</sup> and enthalpy of vaporization = 131 J/mol. ATPROD2 has the corresponding gas-phase species SVTPROD2 and has C* = 485 ug/m<sup>3</sup> and enthalpy of vaporization = 101 J/mol:
```
& oa_type('ATPROD1', 'SVTPROD1', '        ',  0.0000,     0.95, 131.0E3,   0.400, 1.67,  F,  F,  T,  F ),
& oa_type('ATPROD2', 'SVTPROD2', '        ',  0.0000,   485.00, 101.0E3,   0.333, 1.57,  F,  F,  T,  F )
```
To add a nonvolatile aerosol species (assumed anthropogenic):
```
& oa_type('ANONV  ', '        ', '        ',  0.0000,   1.E-10,   1.0E0,   0.667, 2.00,  F,  F,  F,  T )
```
Note that these aerosol definitions do not include a specification of the size bin they fall into. That is added automatically within CMAQ. The last four true/false fields identify the species as POA, anthropogenic, biogenic, and nonvolatile. These fields are used in ELMO calculations of aggregate values like BSOA and ASOA.



<a id=AERO_DATA></a>
### 1.9 Edit AERO_DATA.F
AERO_DATA.F defines all aerosol species and some of their properties. It is located at /$CMAQ_REPO/CCTM/src/aero/aero6/AERO_DATA.F. Note that the aero7 and cracmm directories are linked to the aero6 directory.

You must add a row for every new aerosol species and increase **n_aerolist** to reflect additional species added to the list (in this tutorial add 3). For all species except particulate water and hydronium ion (a tracer), CMAQ now sets no_M2Wet to F.

To add a semivolatile (Vol=REV) organic aerosol species in the Accumulation mode (T,A,C=F,T,F), set OM to T, calculate korg from e.g. Pye et al. (ACP, 2017) or another source, and use properties that match other organic species:
```
& spcs_list_type('ATPROD1 ', F,T,F, cm_set, 1400.0, 'VTRPOD1','     ',0.00,'REV',F,F,  0,  2.8, 6.1,T, 'DUST  ', 0.09),
& spcs_list_type('ATPROD2 ', F,T,F, cm_set, 1400.0, 'VTRPOD2','     ',0.00,'REV',F,F,  0,  2.8, 6.1,T, 'DUST  ', 0.05),
```
To add a nonvolatile (Vol=NVL) organic aerosol species, set no_M2Wet to F:
```
& spcs_list_type('ANONV   ', T,T,F, cm_set, 1400.0, '       ','     ',0.00,'NVL',F,F,  0,  2.8, 6.1,T, 'DUST  ', 0.07),
```
Note that these aerosol names do not include a specification of the size bin they fall into. That is instead indicated by the first three T/F fields (i.e. Aitken, Accumulation and Coarse). When CMAQ expands the variables from the AE namelist to the aerosol modes, it checks this table to make sure that mode is allowed for the species being considered. The condensable vapor in equilribium with the aerosol species should also be specified (e.g. VTRPOD1), as well as the reaction counter (e.g. ALKRXN), if it exists , and the kind of mass-transfer category the species fits (e.g. REV = reversible; IRV = Irreversible; NVL = nonvolatile; H2O = water).
After this category, the user must choose whether the species is to be treated as wet (almost none are now except water species).




<a id=hlconst></a>
### 1.10 Edit hlconst.F
hlconst.F calculates Henry's Law constants for species that participate in wet deposition. It's located in the relevant cloud directory at /$CMAQ_REPO/CCTM/src/cloud/*/hlconst.F.

Each new row corresponds to a name used in the 'WET-SCAV SURR' column of the [GC namelist](#GCnml). Increase **MXSPCS** by the number of species added to the list.

Based on the additions to the [GC namelist](#GCnml) in these examples, wet deposition surrogates must be added for TPROD, SVTPROD1, SVTPROD2, and NONVG. The first 3 columns are row numbers in the data matrix. Column 4 is the name of the wet deposition surrogate used in the [GC namelist](#GCnml) and will often be the same as the species name. Column 5 is the Henry's law constant at 298.15 K (M/atm). Column 6 is the enthalpy; for organic semivolatile species with unknown enthalpy, 6.0E+03 may be used. See references listed in hlconst.F for models to calculate Henry's Law constants where experimental data is unavailable.
```
      DATA SUBNAME(217), A(217), E(217) / 'TPROD           ', 3.87E+02,  6.0E+03 /
      DATA SUBNAME(218), A(218), E(218) / 'SVTPROD1        ', 2.97E+06,  6.0E+03 /
      DATA SUBNAME(219), A(219), E(219) / 'SVTPROD2        ', 7.99E+05,  6.0E+03 /
      DATA SUBNAME(220), A(220), E(220) / 'NONVG           ', 2.22E+03,  6.0E+03 /

```
Dry deposition surrogates may also be added, but are not covered in this tutorial.

<a id=elmo></a>
### 1.11 Check ELMO Processing
The [Explicit and Lumped CMAQ Model Output (ELMO)](../Appendix/CMAQ_UG_appendixG_elmo_output.md) module outputs comprehensive aggregate variables directly from CMAQ. One major goal of ELMO is to lower the barrier to making minor mechanism changes/updates like changing the names of organic aerosol (OA) species and needing to then update offline OA calculations. Users should feel confident that most ELMO variables like PM25 mass and OA mass will be handled correctly regardless of the changes they make, but it is recommended to check CCTM/src/driver/ELMO_PROC.F if large changes are made to the species names in the mechanism, especially gas-phase species liken HNO3.


## 2. Build CMAQ Code with New Mechanism
<a id=copy_src></a>
### 2.1 Build CMAQ_PROJECT.
See [Chapter 5](../CMAQ_UG_ch05_running_a_simulation.md) or the [Tutorials](README.md) for more information.


<a id=mech_build></a>
### 2.2 Build New Mechanism
Two options are possible for this step. There are several utilities that must be executed to translate the mechanism inputs into CMAQ souce code. The user may run these manually, or utilize features in the bldit_cctm.csh build script that automatically executes each step without detailed work by the user. This automated workflow is called CMAQ Autochem.


<a id=manual_mech_build></a>
### 2.2.a Manual Mechanism Build Process
<a id=chemmech_build></a>
#### 2.2.a1 Build chemmech.
Copy the source code from CMAQ_REPO to CMAQ_PROJECT.
```
cp -r /$CMAQ_REPO/UTIL/chemmech/ $CMAQ_PROJECT/UTIL/
```
Edit /$CMAQ_PROJECT/UTIL/chemmech/scripts/bldit_chemmech.csh to make sure the correct compiler is set. Then run the build script.
```
./bldit_chemmech.csh
```

<a id=chemmech_run></a>
#### 2.2.a2 Run chemmech.
Edit run_chemmech.csh
- COMPILER
- Update correct Mechanism
- Set CHEMMECH_INPUT to the location of the [mech.def](#mech_def) file you modified above.
- Change the location of the tracer namelist file
```
set TRAC_NML = /$CMAQ_REPO/CCTM/src/MECHS/trac0/Species_Table_TR_0.nml
```
Run:
```
./run_chemmech.csh
```
If successful, it will output, for example:
```
Normal Completion of CHEMMECH
Author is NAME
output written to ../output/cb6r5_ae7_aq
```
and will write RXNS_DATA_MODULE.F90 and RXNS_FUNC_MODULE.F90 to the output path. Check the output mechanism csv, html, and markdown files to confirm that chemmech ran correctly. Copy the two Fortran files to /$CMAQ_REPO/CCTM/src/MECHS/${Mechanism}/.


<a id=ebi_build></a>
#### 2.2.a3 Build+run create_ebi.
Copy the source code from CMAQ_REPO to CMAQ_PROJECT.
```
cp -r /$CMAQ_REPO/UTIL/create_ebi/ /$CMAQ_PROJECT/UTIL/
```
Move bldrun_create_ebi.csh up one directory (from /$CMAQ_PROJECT/UTIL/create_ebi/scripts/ to /$CMAQ_PROJECT/UTIL/create_ebi/). Edit bldrun_create_ebi.csh:
- COMPILER
- Update MECH for your mechanism.
- Set RXNS_DATA_SRC to the location of your chemmech output files.
- Set PAR_NEG_FLAG, DEGRADE_SUBS, SOLVER_DELT, and all MECH_*(species) variables to the setting that matches your mechanism. E.g. for cb6r5_ae7_aq:
```
 setenv PAR_NEG_FLAG    T    
 setenv DEGRADE_SUBS    F    
 setenv SOLVER_DELT     2.5 
```
The reactions added in this tutorial do not affect radical species in ozone chemistry. If it did, we recommend checking predictions using the EBI solver against an alternative gas solver listed in the cctm build script such as ros3 and smvgear. Check Table 1 in the [create_ebi documentation](../../../UTIL/create_ebi/README.md) as an initial list of radical species that may require such benchmarking. The list grows if new radical cycles are added to a mechanism such as radicals from halogen compounds.
Run:
```
./bldrun_create_ebi.csh
```
If successful, it will output:
```
The following 10 output files were created:
     hrdriver.F
     hrsolver.F
     hrdata_mod.F
     hrinit.F
     hrg1.F
     hrg2.F
     hrg3.F
     hrg4.F
     hrprodloss.F
     hrrates.F
Program CR_EBI_SOLVER completed successfully
if ( F == T ) then
exit ( )
```
and will write the hr*.F files to /${CMAQ_HOME}/CMAQv533/UTIL/create_ebi/output/ebi_${Mechanism}/. Copy the hr*.F files to /${CMAQ_REPO}/CCTM/src/gas/ebi_${Mechanism}/.



<a id=cctm_build></a>
#### 2.2.a4 Build the CCTM executable.
See [Chapter 5](../CMAQ_UG_ch05_running_a_simulation.md) or the [Tutorials](README.md) for more information. This will include all of the new files from /${CMAQ_REPO}/CCTM/src/ in /$CMAQ_PROJECT/CCTM/BLD.


<a id=cmaq_run></a>
#### 2.2.a5 Run CCTM and post-processing tools.
See [Chapter 5](../CMAQ_UG_ch05_running_a_simulation.md) for more information about running the CCTM. See [Chapter 8](../CMAQ_UG_ch08_analysis_tools.md) for more information about running AMET, combine, sitecmp, etc. While running these post-processing tools, be sure to set file paths to the new files created in /$CMAQ_REPO or /$CMAQ_PROJECT/CCTM/BLD.


<a id=autochem></a>
### 2.2.b CMAQ Autochem Mechanism Build Process
The CMAQ build script (bldit_cctm.csh) contains code that allows the user to automatically generate new chemical mechanism source code with minimal intervention. Uncomment the following line:
```
#set build_mech 
```
and bldit_cctm.csh will gather the metadata it needs to run the bldit_mech.csh, a wrapper for all of the mechanism generation scripts.  
If you have implemented a new mechanism with a new name, make sure to update that in the 'Mechanism' environment variable, and potentially in the 'ModAero' and 'ModCloud' variables, if applicable.

Because the mechanism files are generated before CMAQ source files are retreived for the model build process, the Autochem tool will always seek to propagate the new mechanism files back to the CMAQ repo. If the mechanism already exists in the repo (e.g. cb6r5_ae7_aq), the script will halt. To allow the Autochem tool to overwrite any existing mechanisms with the new files, uncomment the following line:
```
#set clobber_mech
```
If the mechanism does not already exist, then clobber_mech will have no effect, and new mechanism folder will appear in the repo consistent with the new files.


<a id=github></a>
## 3. Reflecting the changes in Github ##
### 3.1 Fork from USEPA CMAQ.
On the [CMAQ Github page](../../../README.md), fork the main branch to your personal repository using the Fork button in the upper right.

### 3.2 Clone.
Clone your repository to your remote account. For example:
```
git clone https://username@github.com/username/CMAQ.git CMAQ_REPO_v533
```
This will request your Github password. You will now see the entire CMAQ repository in the directory you cloned it into. If you enter the top directory (e.g. CMAQ_REPO_v533/), there should now exist a file named .git.

### 3.3 Rename remote.
Rename the remote link. For example:
```
git remote rename origin dev_push_repo
```

### 3.4 Link to USEPA CMAQ.
Link the cloned repo to the USEPA Github repo.
```
git remote add dev_repo https://username@github.com/USEPA/CMAQ.git
```

### 3.5 Branching.
When modifying your repository, it is a good idea to check out a new branch. To create the branch:
```
git branch newchem
```
To move to that branch:
```
git checkout newchem
```
To look at all of your branches:
```
git branch
```
The branch you are currently working from will have an asterisk.

### 3.6 Modify the mechanism according to the [instructions](#modifychem) above.
If the USEPA repository is updated by EPA, you will see a statement such as "This branch is X commits behind USEPA:main" in Github online. You will likely want to keep your CMAQ up-to-date and will want to pull the updates to your repo. Make sure the files you have edited are backed up.
Check the names of your remotes using:
```
git remote -v
```
If you have followed these instructions, your repository should be named dev_push_repo and the USEPA's repository should be named dev_repo. To pull in the updates from USEPA's main branch:
```
git pull dev_repo main
```
To view a summary of the changes you have made to your repo since your last commit, type "git status" from anywhere in the repo. If you have followed the instructions above, you should see:
```
# On branch newchem
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
