CMAQ Tutorials
==============

A series of short tutorials provide practical examples of how to set up and run CMAQ, exercise different features in the software, and better understand the software system. Community members are encouraged to both suggest ideas for new tutorials and to contribute tutorials directly to this repository. [Contact the CMAS Center](cmas@unc.edu) with new tutorial ideas.

- [Running the CMAQ Test Case](CMAQ_UG_tutorial_benchmark.md): This tutorial describes how to prepare your Linux system for installing and running the CMAQ test case.
- [Building CMAQ for GNU](CMAQ_Build_Using_Module_Load_GNU.md): This tutorial describes how to install netCDF and I/O API libraries and build CMAQ using the GNU GCC compiler version 9.1.0. 
- [Building CMAQ for Intel](CMAQ_Build_Using_Module_Load_Intel.md): This tutorial describes how to install netCDF and I/O API libraries and build CMAQ using the Intel compiler version 18.2. 
- [Prescribing Emissions Using the DESID Module](CMAQ_UG_tutorial_emissions.md): This tutorial describes how to use the Emission Control namelist to manipulate emission inputs, e.g. zero out emissions, scaling emissions, adding emissions for a new tracer.
- [Creating an OCEAN file](CMAQ_UG_tutorial_oceanfile.md): This tutorial describes methods to a CMAQ Ocean file.
- [Adding an Inert Tracer Species to CMAQ](CMAQ_UG_tutorial_tracers.md): This tutorial will step you through the process of adding chemically inert tracers to the CMAQ model.  
- [Create Initial and Boundary Conditions from Seasonal Average Hemispheric CMAQ Output](HCMAQ_IC_BC_Tutorial.md): This tutorial will step the user through the process of creating initial and boundary conditions from a seasonal average hemispheric CMAQ output file distributed through the CMAS data warehouse.
